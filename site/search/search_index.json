They\u2019re the feelings, thoughts, and shared history that tie you together. You will always have at least one bond, and you\u2019ll often have more. Each bond is a simple statement that relates your character to another player character. Your class gives you a few to start with, you\u2019ll replace your starting bonds and gain new ones through play.</p>"},{"location":"Bonds%20and%20Alignment/#resolving-bonds","title":"Resolving Bonds","text":"<p>At the end of each session you may resolve one bond. Resolution of a bond depends on both you and the player of the character you share the bond with: you suggest that the bond has been resolved and, if they agree, it is. When you resolve a bond, you get to mark XP. A bond is resolved when it no longer describes how you relate to that person. That may be because circumstances have changed\u2014Thelian used to have your back but after he abandoned you to the goblins, you\u2019re not so sure. Or it could be because that\u2019s no longer a question\u2014you guided Wesley before and he owed you, but he paid that debt when he saved your life with a well-timed spell. Any time you look at a bond and think \u201cthat\u2019s not a big factor in how we relate anymore\u201d the bond is at a good place to resolve. If you have a blank bond left over from character creation you can assign a name to it or write a new bond in its place whenever you like. You don\u2019t get an XP for doing so, but you do get more defined bonds to resolve in the future.</p>"},{"location":"Bonds%20and%20Alignment/#writing-new-bonds","title":"Writing New Bonds","text":"<p>You write a new bond whenever you resolve an old one. Your new bond may be with the same character, but it doesn\u2019t have to be.  When you write a new bond choose another character. Pick something relevant to the last session\u2014maybe a place you travelled together or a treasure you discovered. Choose a thought or belief your character holds that ties the two together and an action, something you\u2019re going to do about it. You\u2019ll end up with something like this:  Mouse\u2019s quick thinking saved me from the white dragon we faced. I owe her a boon. Avon proved himself a coward in the dungeons ofXax\u2019takar. He is a dangerous liability to the party and must be watched. Valeria\u2019s kindness to the Gnomes of the Vale has swayed my heart, I will prove to her I am not the callous fiend she thinks I am. Xotoq won the Bone-and-Whispers Axe through trickery! It will be mine, I swear it. These new bonds are just like the old ones\u2014use them, resolve them,replace them.</p>"},{"location":"Bonds%20and%20Alignment/#alignment","title":"Alignment","text":"<p>Alignment is your character\u2019s way of thinking and moral compass. For the character, this can be an ethical ideal, religious strictures, or maybe just a gut instinct. It reflects the things your character might aspire to be and can guide you when you\u2019re not sure what to do next. Some characters might proudly proclaim their alignment while others might hide it away. A character might not say, \u201cI\u2019m an evil person,\u201d but may instead say, \u201cI put myself first.\u201d  That\u2019s all well and good for a character, but the world knows otherwise. Buried deep down inside is the ideal self a person wants to become\u2014it is this mystic core that certain spells and abilities tap into when detecting someone\u2019s alignment. Every sentient creature in Dungeon World bears an alignment, be they an elf, a human, or some other, stranger thing. The alignments are Good, Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic, and Evil. Each one shows an aspiration to be a different type of person.  Lawful creatures aspire to impose order on the world, either for their own benefit or for that of others.  Chaotic creatures embrace change and idealize the messy reality of the world, prizing freedom above all else.  Good creatures seek to put others before themselves.  Evil creatures put themselves first at the expense of others. A Neutral creature looks out for itself so long as that doesn\u2019t jeopardize someone else\u2019s well-being. Neutral characters are content to live their lives and pursue their own goals and let others do the same. Most creatures are Neutral. They take no particular pleasure in harming others, but will do it if it is justified by their situation. Those that put an ideal\u2014be it Law, Chaos, Good, or Evil\u2014above themselves are harder to find. Even two creatures of the same alignment can come into conflict. Aspiring to help others does not grant infallibility, two Good creatures may fight and die over two different views of how to do right. </p>"},{"location":"Bonds%20and%20Alignment/#changing-alignment","title":"Changing Alignment","text":"<p>Alignment can, and will, change. Usually such a change comes about as a gradual move toward a decisive moment. Any time a character\u2019s view of the world has fundamentally shifted they can chose a new alignment. The player must have a reason for the change which they can explain to the other players. In some cases a player character may switch alignment moves while still keeping the same alignment. This reflects a smaller shift, one of priority instead of a wholesale shift in thinking. They simply choose a new move for the same alignment from below and mention why their character now sees this as important.</p>"},{"location":"Bonds%20and%20Alignment/#lawful","title":"Lawful","text":"<ul> <li>Uphold the letter of the law over the spirit</li> <li>Fulfill a promise of import</li> <li>Bring someone to justice</li> <li>Choose honor over personal gain</li> <li>Return treasure to its rightful owner</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Bonds%20and%20Alignment/#good","title":"Good","text":"<ul> <li>Ignore danger to aid another</li> <li>Lead others into righteous battle</li> <li>Give up powers or riches for the greater good</li> <li>Reveal a dangerous lie</li> <li>Show mercy</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Bonds%20and%20Alignment/#neutral","title":"Neutral","text":"<ul> <li>Make an ally of someone powerful</li> <li>Defeat a personally important foe</li> <li>Learn a secret about an enemy</li> <li>Uncover a hidden truth</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Bonds%20and%20Alignment/#chaotic","title":"Chaotic","text":"<ul> <li>Reveal corruption</li> <li>Break an unjust law to benefit another</li> <li>Defeat a tyrant</li> <li>Reveal hypocrisy</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Bonds%20and%20Alignment/#evil","title":"Evil","text":"<ul> <li>Take advantage of someone\u2019s trust</li> <li>Cause suffering for its own sake</li> <li>Destroy something beautiful</li> <li>Upset the rightful order</li> <li>Harm an innocent</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Character%20creation/","title":"Character creation","text":""},{"location":"Character%20creation/#1-choose-a-playbook","title":"1) Choose a playbook","text":"<p>Look over the Character playbooks and choose one.

Damage can never take a character below 0 HP.  Damage is determined by the attacker. Player characters deal damage according to their class, the weapon used, and the move they\u2019ve made. If a move just says \u201cdeal damage\u201d the character rolls their class\u2019s damage dice plus any bonuses or penalties from moves, weapons, or effects. If a move specifies an amount of damage, use that in place of the class\u2019s damage roll. Monsters roll damage as listed in their description. Use this damage any time the monster takes direct action to hurt someone, even if they use a method other than their normal attack. Other sources of damage\u2014like being struck by a chunk of a collapsing tower, or falling into a pit\u2014are left to the GM based on these options:</p> <ul> <li>It threatens bruises and scrapes at worst: d4 damage</li> <li>It\u2019s likely to spill some blood, but nothing horrendous: d6 damage</li> <li>It might break some bones: d8 damage</li> <li>It could kill a common person: d10 damage   Add the ignores armor tag if the source of the damage is particularly large or if the damage comes from magic or poison.   Temporary or circumstantial armor works the same way as armor that you wear: 1 armor for partial cover, 2 armor for major cover.   Damage is dealt based on the fiction. Moves that deal damage, like hack and slash, are just a special case of this: the move establishes that damage is being dealt in the fiction. Damage can be assigned even when no move is made, if it follows from the fiction.   HP loss is often only part of the effect. If the harm is generalized, like falling into a pit, losing the HP is probably all there is to it. When the harm is specific, like an orc pulling your arm from its socket, HP should be part of the effect but not the entirety of it.

The GM will tell them what it will cost to return your poor, dead character to life. If you fulfill the GM\u2019s conditions the character is returned to life.

Debilities don\u2019t replace descriptions and using the established fiction. When someone loses an arm that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re Weak, it means they have one less arm.

When a player describes their character doing something that triggers a move, that move happens and its rules apply. If the move requires a roll, its description will tell you what dice to roll and how to read their results. A character can\u2019t take the fictional action that triggers a move without that move occurring.

Weapons are particularly likely to modify what moves you can trigger. A character with a dagger can easily stab the goblin gnawing on his leg, triggering hack and slash, but the character with a halberd is going to have a much harder time bringing it to bear on such a close foe.

If the enemy isn\u2019t prepared for your attack\u2014if they don\u2019t know you\u2019re there or they\u2019re restrained and helpless\u2014then that\u2019s not hack and slash. You just deal your damage or murder them outright, depending on the situation. Nasty stuff.  The enemy\u2019s counterattack can be any GM move made directly with that creature. A goblin might just attack you back, or they might jam a poisoned needle into your veins. Life\u2019s tough, isn\u2019t it? Note that an \u201cattack\u201d is some action that a player undertakes that has a chance of causing physical harm to someone else. Attacking a dragon with inch-thick metal scales full of magical energy using a typical sword is like swinging a meat cleaver at a tank: it just isn\u2019t going to cause any harm, so hack and slash doesn\u2019t apply. Note that circumstances can change that: if you\u2019re in a position to stab the dragon on its soft underbelly (good luck with getting there) it could hurt, so it\u2019s an attack.  If the action that triggers the move could reasonably hurt multiple targets roll once and apply damage to each target (they each get their armor).  Some attacks may have additional effects depending on the triggering action, the circumstances, or the weapons involved. An attack could also knock someone down, restrain them, or leave a big bloody splatter.</p>"},{"location":"Moves/Basic%20moves/#volley","title":"Volley","text":"<p>When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, roll+Dex. \u2734On a 10+, you have a clear shot\u2014deal your damage. \u2734On a 7\u20139, choose one (whichever you choose you deal your damage):</p> <ul> <li>You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described by the GM</li> <li>You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage</li> <li>You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one </li> </ul> <p>Volley covers the entire act of drawing, aiming, and firing a ranged weapon or throwing a thrown weapon.

You defy danger when you do something in the face of impending peril. This may seem like a catch-all. It is! Defy danger is for those times when it seems like you clearly should be rolling but no other move applies.   Defy danger also applies when you make another move despite danger not covered by that move. For example, hack and slash assumes that\u2019s you\u2019re trading blows in battle\u2014you don\u2019t need to defy danger because of the monster you\u2019re fighting unless there\u2019s some specific danger that wouldn\u2019t be part of your normal attack.    On the other hand, if you\u2019re trying to hack and slash while spikes shoot from hidden traps in the walls, those spikes are a whole different danger. Danger, here, is anything that requires resilience, concentration, or poise.    This move will usually be called for by the GM. She\u2019ll tell you what the danger is as you make the move. Something like \u201cYou\u2019ll have to defy danger first. The danger is the steep and icy floor you\u2019re running across. If you can keep your footing, you can make it to the door before the necromancer\u2019s magic gets you.\u201d Which stat applies depends on what action you take and your action has to trigger the move.    That means you can\u2019t defy danger from a steep and icy floor with a charming smile just so you can use Cha, since charmingly smiling at the icy floor does nothing to it. On the other hand, making a huge leap over the ice would be Str, placing your feet carefully would be Dex, and so on.

When you\u2019re no longer nearby or you stop devoting your attention to incoming attacks then you lose any hold you might have had. You can only spend hold when someone makes an attack on you or the thing you\u2019re defending. The choices you can make depend on the attacker and the type of attack. In particular, you can\u2019t deal damage to an attacker who you can\u2019t reach with your weapon.  An attack is any action you can interfere with that has harmful effects. Swords and arrows are attacks, of course, but so are spells, grabs, and charges. If the attack doesn\u2019t deal damage then halving it means the attacker gets some of what they want but not all of it. It\u2019s up to you and the GM to work out what that means depending on the circumstances. If you\u2019re defending the Gem Eye of Oro-Uht and an orc tries to grab it from its pedestal then half effect might mean that the gem gets knocked to the floor but the orc doesn\u2019t get his hands on it, yet. Or maybe the orc gets a hold of it but so do you\u2014now you\u2019re both fighting over it, tooth and nail.  If you and the GM can\u2019t agree on a halved effect you can\u2019t choose that option.

Discerning realities isn\u2019t just about noticing a detail, it\u2019s about figuring out the bigger picture. The GM always describes what the player characters experience honestly, so during a fight the GM will say that the kobold mage stays at the other end of the hall.  Discerning realities could reveal the reason behind that: the kobold\u2019s motions reveal that he\u2019s actually pulling energy from the room behind him, he can\u2019t come any closer. Just like spout lore, the answers you get are always honest ones. Even if the GM has to figure it out on the spot. Once they answer, it\u2019s set in stone. You\u2019ll want to discern realities to find the truth behind illusions\u2014magical or otherwise. Unless a move says otherwise players can only ask questions from the list. If a player asks a question not on the list the GM can tell them to try again or answer a question from the list that seems equivalent.  Of course, some questions might have a negative answer, that\u2019s fine.

You know you\u2019re using parley when you\u2019re trying to get someone to do something for you by holding a promise or threat over them. Your leverage can be nasty or nice, the tone doesn\u2019t matter. Merely asking someone politely isn\u2019t parleying. That\u2019s just talking. You say, \u201cCan I have that magic sword?\u201d and Sir Telric says, \u201cHell no, this is my blade, my father forged it and my mother enchanted it\u201d and that\u2019s that. To parley, you have to have leverage.  Leverage is anything that could lure the target of your parley to do something for you. Maybe it\u2019s something they want or something they don\u2019t want you to do. Like a sack of gold. Or punching them in the face. What counts as leverage depends on the people involved and the request being made. Threaten a lone goblin with death and you have leverage. Threaten a goblin backed up by his gang with death and he might think he\u2019s better off in a fight.  On a 7+ they ask you for something related to whatever leverage you have. If your leverage is that you\u2019re standing before them sharpening your knife and insinuating about how much you\u2019d like to shank them with it they might ask you to let them go. If your leverage is your position in court above them they might ask for a favor.  Whatever they ask for, on a 10+, you just have to promise it clearly and unambiguously. On a 7\u20139, that\u2019s not enough: you also have to give them some assurance, right now, before they do what you want.  If you promise that you\u2019ll ensure their safety from the wolves if they do what you want and you roll a 7\u20139 they won\u2019t do their part until you bring a fresh wolf pelt to prove you can do it, for example.  It\u2019s worth noting that you don\u2019t actually have to keep your promise. Whether you\u2019ll follow up or not, well, that\u2019s up to you. Of course breaking promises leads to problems. People don\u2019t take kindly to oath-breakers and aren\u2019t likely to deal with them in the future.  In some cases when you state what you want you may include a possible promise for the creature to make, as in \u201cflee and I\u2019ll let you live.\u201d It\u2019s up to the target of the parley if that\u2019s the promise they want or if they have something else in mind. They can say \u201cyes, let me live and I\u2019ll go\u201d (with assurances, if you rolled a 7\u20139) or \u201cpromise me you won\u2019t follow me.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Moves/Basic%20moves/#aid-or-interfere","title":"Aid or Interfere","text":"<p>When you help or hinder someone , roll+bond with them. \u2734On a 10+, they take +1 or -2 to their roll, your choice. \u2734On a 7\u20139, they still get a modifier, but you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost. </p> <p>Any time you feel like two players should be rolling against each other, the defender should be interfering with the attacker.
