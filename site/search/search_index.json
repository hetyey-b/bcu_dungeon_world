At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy\u2019s attack. \u2734On a 7\u20139, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you. Hack and slash is for attacking a prepared enemy plain and simple. If the enemy isn\u2019t prepared for your attack\u2014if they don\u2019t know you\u2019re there or they\u2019re restrained and helpless\u2014then that\u2019s not hack and slash. You just deal your damage or murder them outright, depending on the situation. Nasty stuff. The enemy\u2019s counterattack can be any GM move made directly with that creature. A goblin might just attack you back, or they might jam a poisoned needle into your veins. Life\u2019s tough, isn\u2019t it? Note that an \u201cattack\u201d is some action that a player undertakes that has a chance of causing physical harm to someone else. Attacking a dragon with inch-thick metal scales full of magical energy using a typical sword is like swinging a meat cleaver at a tank: it just isn\u2019t going to cause any harm, so hack and slash doesn\u2019t apply. Note that circumstances can change that: if you\u2019re in a position to stab the dragon on its soft underbelly (good luck with getting there) it could hurt, so it\u2019s an attack. If the action that triggers the move could reasonably hurt multiple targets roll once and apply damage to each target (they each get their armor). Some attacks may have additional effects depending on the triggering action, the circumstances, or the weapons involved. An attack could also knock someone down, restrain them, or leave a big bloody splatter. Volley When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, roll+Dex. \u2734On a 10+, you have a clear shot\u2014deal your damage. \u2734On a 7\u20139, choose one (whichever you choose you deal your damage): - You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described by the GM - You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage - You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one Volley covers the entire act of drawing, aiming, and firing a ranged weapon or throwing a thrown weapon. The advantage to using a ranged weapon over melee is that the attacker is less likely to be attacked back. Of course they do have to worry about ammunition and getting a clear shot though. On a 7\u20139, read \u201cdanger\u201d broadly. It can be bad footing or ending in the path of a sword or maybe just giving up your sweet sniper nest to your enemies. Whatever it is, it\u2019s impending and it\u2019s always something that causes the GM to say \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d Quite often, the danger will be something that will then require you to dedicate yourself to avoiding it or force you to defy danger. If you\u2019re throwing something that doesn\u2019t have ammo (maybe you\u2019ve got a move that makes your shield throwable) you can\u2019t choose to mark off ammo. Choose from the other two options instead. Defy Danger When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it\u2026 - \u2026by powering through, +Str - \u2026by getting out of the way or acting fast, +Dex - \u2026by enduring, +Con - \u2026with quick thinking, +Int - \u2026through mental fortitude, +Wis - \u2026using charm and social grace, +Cha \u2734On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn\u2019t come to bear. \u2734On a 7\u20139, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice. You defy danger when you do something in the face of impending peril. This may seem like a catch-all. It is! Defy danger is for those times when it seems like you clearly should be rolling but no other move applies. Defy danger also applies when you make another move despite danger not covered by that move. For example, hack and slash assumes that\u2019s you\u2019re trading blows in battle\u2014you don\u2019t need to defy danger because of the monster you\u2019re fighting unless there\u2019s some specific danger that wouldn\u2019t be part of your normal attack. On the other hand, if you\u2019re trying to hack and slash while spikes shoot from hidden traps in the walls, those spikes are a whole different danger. Danger, here, is anything that requires resilience, concentration, or poise. This move will usually be called for by the GM. She\u2019ll tell you what the danger is as you make the move. Something like \u201cYou\u2019ll have to defy danger first. The danger is the steep and icy floor you\u2019re running across. If you can keep your footing, you can make it to the door before the necromancer\u2019s magic gets you.\u201d Which stat applies depends on what action you take and your action has to trigger the move. That means you can\u2019t defy danger from a steep and icy floor with a charming smile just so you can use Cha, since charmingly smiling at the icy floor does nothing to it. On the other hand, making a huge leap over the ice would be Str, placing your feet carefully would be Dex, and so on. Make the move to get the results. Defend When you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under attack, roll+Con. \u2734On a 10+, hold 3. \u2734On a 7\u20139, hold 1. As long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option: - Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself - Halve the attack\u2019s effect or damage - Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker - Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level Defending something means standing nearby and focusing on preventing attacks against that thing or stopping anyone from getting near it. When you\u2019re no longer nearby or you stop devoting your attention to incoming attacks then you lose any hold you might have had. You can only spend hold when someone makes an attack on you or the thing you\u2019re defending. The choices you can make depend on the attacker and the type of attack. In particular, you can\u2019t deal damage to an attacker who you can\u2019t reach with your weapon. An attack is any action you can interfere with that has harmful effects. Swords and arrows are attacks, of course, but so are spells, grabs, and charges. If the attack doesn\u2019t deal damage then halving it means the attacker gets some of what they want but not all of it. It\u2019s up to you and the GM to work out what that means depending on the circumstances. If you\u2019re defending the Gem Eye of Oro-Uht and an orc tries to grab it from its pedestal then half effect might mean that the gem gets knocked to the floor but the orc doesn\u2019t get his hands on it, yet. Or maybe the orc gets a hold of it but so do you\u2014now you\u2019re both fighting over it, tooth and nail. If you and the GM can\u2019t agree on a halved effect you can\u2019t choose that option. Defending yourself is certainly an option. It amounts to giving up on making attacks and just trying to keep yourself safe. Spout Lore When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll+Int. \u2734On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. \u2734On a 7\u20139, the GM will only tell you something interesting\u2014it\u2019s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d Tell them the truth, now. You spout lore any time you want to search your memory for knowledge or facts about something. You take a moment to ponder the things you know about the Orcish Tribes or the Tower of Ul\u2019dammar and then reveal that knowledge. The knowledge you get is like consulting a bestiary, travel guide, or library. You get facts about the subject matter. On a 10+ the GM will show you how those facts can be immediately useful, on a 7\u20139 they\u2019re just facts. On a miss the GM\u2019s move will often involve the time you take thinking. Maybe you miss that goblin moving around behind you, or the tripwire across the hallway. It\u2019s also a great chance to reveal an unwelcome truth. Just in case it isn\u2019t clear: the answers are always true, even if the GM had to make them up on the spot. Always say what honesty demands. Discern Realities When you closely study a situation or person, roll+Wis. \u2734On a 10+, ask the GM 3 questions from the list below. \u2734On a 7\u20139, ask 1. Either way, take +1 forward when acting on the answers. - What happened here recently? - What is about to happen? - What should I be on the lookout for? - What here is useful or valuable to me? - Who\u2019s really in control here? - What here is not what it appears to be? To discern realities you must closely observe your target. That usually means interacting with it or watching someone else do the same. You can\u2019t just stick your head in the doorway and discern realities about a room. You\u2019re not merely scanning for clues\u2014you have to look under and around things, tap the walls, and check for weird dust patterns on the bookshelves. That sort of thing. Discerning realities isn\u2019t just about noticing a detail, it\u2019s about figuring out the bigger picture. The GM always describes what the player characters experience honestly, so during a fight the GM will say that the kobold mage stays at the other end of the hall. Discerning realities could reveal the reason behind that: the kobold\u2019s motions reveal that he\u2019s actually pulling energy from the room behind him, he can\u2019t come any closer. Just like spout lore, the answers you get are always honest ones. Even if the GM has to figure it out on the spot. Once they answer, it\u2019s set in stone. You\u2019ll want to discern realities to find the truth behind illusions\u2014magical or otherwise. Unless a move says otherwise players can only ask questions from the list. If a player asks a question not on the list the GM can tell them to try again or answer a question from the list that seems equivalent. Of course, some questions might have a negative answer, that\u2019s fine. If there really, honestly is nothing useful or valuable here, the GM will answer that question with \u201cNothing, sorry.\u201d Parley When you have leverage on a GM Character and manipulate them, roll+Cha. Leverage is something they need or want. \u2734On a 10+, they do what you ask if you first promise what they ask of you. \u2734On a 7\u20139, they will do what you ask, but need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now. Parley covers a lot of ground including old standbys like intimidation and diplomacy. You know you\u2019re using parley when you\u2019re trying to get someone to do something for you by holding a promise or threat over them. Your leverage can be nasty or nice, the tone doesn\u2019t matter. Merely asking someone politely isn\u2019t parleying. That\u2019s just talking. You say, \u201cCan I have that magic sword?\u201d and Sir Telric says, \u201cHell no, this is my blade, my father forged it and my mother enchanted it\u201d and that\u2019s that. To parley, you have to have leverage. Leverage is anything that could lure the target of your parley to do something for you. Maybe it\u2019s something they want or something they don\u2019t want you to do. Like a sack of gold. Or punching them in the face. What counts as leverage depends on the people involved and the request being made. Threaten a lone goblin with death and you have leverage. Threaten a goblin backed up by his gang with death and he might think he\u2019s better off in a fight. On a 7+ they ask you for something related to whatever leverage you have. If your leverage is that you\u2019re standing before them sharpening your knife and insinuating about how much you\u2019d like to shank them with it they might ask you to let them go. If your leverage is your position in court above them they might ask for a favor. Whatever they ask for, on a 10+, you just have to promise it clearly and unambiguously. On a 7\u20139, that\u2019s not enough: you also have to give them some assurance, right now, before they do what you want. If you promise that you\u2019ll ensure their safety from the wolves if they do what you want and you roll a 7\u20139 they won\u2019t do their part until you bring a fresh wolf pelt to prove you can do it, for example. It\u2019s worth noting that you don\u2019t actually have to keep your promise. Whether you\u2019ll follow up or not, well, that\u2019s up to you. Of course breaking promises leads to problems. People don\u2019t take kindly to oath-breakers and aren\u2019t likely to deal with them in the future. In some cases when you state what you want you may include a possible promise for the creature to make, as in \u201cflee and I\u2019ll let you live.\u201d It\u2019s up to the target of the parley if that\u2019s the promise they want or if they have something else in mind. They can say \u201cyes, let me live and I\u2019ll go\u201d (with assurances, if you rolled a 7\u20139) or \u201cpromise me you won\u2019t follow me.\u201d Aid or Interfere When you help or hinder someone , roll+bond with them. \u2734On a 10+, they take +1 or -2 to their roll, your choice. \u2734On a 7\u20139, they still get a modifier, but you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost. Any time you feel like two players should be rolling against each other, the defender should be interfering with the attacker. This doesn\u2019t always mean sabotaging them. It can mean anything from arguing against a parley to just being a shifty person who\u2019s hard to discern. It\u2019s about getting in the way of another players\u2019 success. Always ask the person aiding or interfering how they are doing it. As long as they can answer that, they trigger the move. Sometimes, as the GM, you\u2019ll have to ask if interference is happening. Your players might not always notice they\u2019re interfering with each other. Aid is a little more obvious. If a player can explain how they\u2019re helping with a move and it makes sense, let them roll to aid. No matter how many people aid or interfere with a given roll, the target only gets the +1 or -2 once. Even if a whole party of adventurers aid in attacking an ogre, the one who makes the final attack only gets +1.","title":"Basic moves"},{"location":"Basic%20moves/#hack-and-slash","text":"When you attack an enemy in melee, roll+Str. \u2734On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack.

Any time you feel like two players should be rolling against each other, the defender should be interfering with the attacker. This doesn\u2019t always mean sabotaging them. It can mean anything from arguing against a parley to just being a shifty person who\u2019s hard to discern. It\u2019s about getting in the way of another players\u2019 success. Always ask the person aiding or interfering how they are doing it. As long as they can answer that, they trigger the move. Sometimes, as the GM, you\u2019ll have to ask if interference is happening. Your players might not always notice they\u2019re interfering with each other. Aid is a little more obvious. If a player can explain how they\u2019re helping with a move and it makes sense, let them roll to aid. No matter how many people aid or interfere with a given roll, the target only gets the +1 or -2 once.

Each bond is a simple statement that relates your character to another player character. Your class gives you a few to start with, you\u2019ll replace your starting bonds and gain new ones through play. Resolving Bonds At the end of each session you may resolve one bond. Resolution of a bond depends on both you and the player of the character you share the bond with: you suggest that the bond has been resolved and, if they agree, it is. When you resolve a bond, you get to mark XP. A bond is resolved when it no longer describes how you relate to that person. That may be because circumstances have changed\u2014Thelian used to have your back but after he abandoned you to the goblins, you\u2019re not so sure.

If you have a blank bond left over from character creation you can assign a name to it or write a new bond in its place whenever you like.

Your new bond may be with the same character, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. When you write a new bond choose another character.

Alignment Alignment is your character\u2019s way of thinking and moral compass. For the character, this can be an ethical ideal, religious strictures, or maybe just a gut instinct. It reflects the things your character might aspire to be and can guide you when you\u2019re not sure what to do next. Some characters might proudly proclaim their alignment while others might hide it away. A character might not say, \u201cI\u2019m an evil person,\u201d but may instead say, \u201cI put myself first.\u201d That\u2019s all well and good for a character, but the world knows otherwise.

Each one shows an aspiration to be a different type of person. Lawful creatures aspire to impose order on the world, either for their own benefit or for that of others. Chaotic creatures embrace change and idealize the messy reality of the world, prizing freedom above all else. Good creatures seek to put others before themselves. Evil creatures put themselves first at the expense of others. A Neutral creature looks out for itself so long as that doesn\u2019t jeopardize someone else\u2019s well-being. Neutral characters are content to live their lives and pursue their own goals and let others do the same. Most creatures are Neutral. They take no particular pleasure in harming others, but will do it if it is justified by their situation. Those that put an ideal\u2014be it Law, Chaos, Good, or Evil\u2014above themselves are harder to find. Even two creatures of the same alignment can come into conflict. Aspiring to help others does not grant infallibility, two Good creatures may fight and die over two different views of how to do right. Changing Alignment Alignment can, and will, change. Usually such a change comes about as a gradual move toward a decisive moment. Any time a character\u2019s view of the world has fundamentally shifted they can chose a new alignment. The player must have a reason for the change which they can explain to the other players. In some cases a player character may switch alignment moves while still keeping the same alignment.

We are not as strong as the Orcs, nor as graceful as the Elves. We cannot match the heartiness of the Dwarves, and unlike the Drakarn, we live short, brutal lives. But who can match our diversity? Who can adapt to this cruel world as well as we? Humanity has spread from sea to mountain, from desert to swamp. In the midst of every forest, you will find a village that somehow manages to scrape by and survive. This is what it means to be human. Special move: Human plasticity When creating a character, you may choose to take a Starting Move from any class playbook not already in use. However, one of your existing Starting Moves becomes an Advanced Move (you lose it, but you can choose it later when you level up). The GM will ask you how you came to learn the ability. Dwarf You must always remember the sacrifice at Mount Ath\u00fbn. Remember the defeat. Remember the triumph. Do not expect others to understand. They will blame you for the appearance of the demonkin and say that it was the Dwarves who unleashed horror upon the land. It is true we delved deeply, but know it was hell itself that clawed up through the earth to meet our tunnels. Special move: Dwarven battlebond The sacrifice of Mount Ath\u00fbn has united the Dwarven people. When you meet another dwarf, they always treat you as a trusted ally as long as you do the same. Elf Where are you? We are gone now, you know this. The time of the Elves has passed. Why did you stay? This world belongs to darkness and shadow. Even our people could not hope to shine light into the world. The corruption was seeping into our forests, could you not feel it? Our highland kin say the taint of evil was even spreading to their soil. This world is doomed. And so the elvish fleet set sail one last time. May we find peace across the sea. Special move: Elvish artifact When the other elves sailed across the sea, they left you a powerful weapon or item. It is one of the last known elvish artifacts. Work with the GM to create this item (it should have above average stats or possibly even magical properties), then name it. Tusker It is not wise to underestimate a tusker. Behind our calm demeanor is an intensity. Look deeply and you will see, as if we were sitting by firelight, a dancing flame of fury reflected in our eyes. To awaken a tusker\u2019s temper is to beckon unto death. Special move: Berserker tusker When you\u2019re below 10 HP, you can choose one damage die to reroll per attack Halfling They call us weak! They call us tiny! Runty! Insubstantial! Pint-sized! Bah! Even the common name for our people \u201chalfling\u201d makes us seem lesser. But we are none of these! We have within us potential for true power! We must only seize the opportunity.

When you Parley using your preferred type of power as leverage, always treat 7-9 as 10+ Drakarn You may think us a proud people, but those that look deep enough to pierce our pride will see our eyes filled with sorrow. We are dying. No, not of age, time only makes us stronger. Not of disease, for our blood remains pure. But yet, we, our people, grow fewer in number every time another drakarn is laid to rest. Dark memories haunt every female drakarn, of eggs turning to dust with a touch, or worse, hatching unspeakable horrors. The eldest of us, as few as they are, speak of the Broodmother, she who gave life to us all, she who slumbers in a forgotten place, she who knows the secrets of our infertility. And so we wander the world, and search. May she be found before there is no one left to look. Special move: Drakarn Broodmate You have met all other drakarn. When you come across one, the GM will tell you useful information about them or ask you to come up with some. Special move: Flamegut When you belch, two things catch fire. Choose one. The GM chooses the other. Infernal The hot blood of a demon flows through you. Was it your father that made the bargain? Your mother? Was it you who chose the dark pact? Do not speak, you need not answer. I am not here to pass judgment. I see your horns have grown in splendidly. Do not be ashamed of them. Others will say they are the mark of true evil. They will call you fiend and hellspawn. But their words do not hold power. There is a will inside you, and it is more powerful than most. Whether they call you good, or evil, or psychotic, it matters not. Special move: Infernal temptation When you tempt someone and they act against their nature, alignment, or conscience, take +1 forward. Kobold All will bow to the glory of Saranak!

A move depends on a fictional action and always has some fictional effect. \u201cFictional\u201d means that the action and effect come from the world of the characters we\u2019re describing. In the move above the trigger is \u201cwhen you attack an enemy in melee.\u201d The effect is what follows: a roll to be made and differing fictional effects based on the outcome of the roll. When a player describes their character doing something that triggers a move, that move happens and its rules apply. If the move requires a roll, its description will tell you what dice to roll and how to read their results. A character can\u2019t take the fictional action that triggers a move without that move occurring. For example, if Isaac tells the GM that his character dashes past a crazed axe-wielding orc to the open door, he makes the defy danger move because its trigger is \u201cwhen you act despite an imminent threat.\u201d Isaac can\u2019t just describe his character running past the orc without making the defy danger move and he can\u2019t make the defy danger move without acting despite an imminent threat or suffering a calamity. The moves and the fiction go hand-in-hand. Everyone at the table should listen for when moves apply. If it\u2019s ever unclear if a move has been triggered, everyone should work together to clarify what\u2019s happening. Ask questions of everyone involved until everyone sees the situation the same way and then roll the dice, or don\u2019t, as the situation requires. The GM\u2019s monsters, NPCs, and other assorted beasties also have moves, but they work differently. Moves and dice Most moves include the phrase \u201croll+x\u201d where \u201cx\u201d is one of your character\u2019s ability modifiers (CON for example). Unless the move tells you otherwise, that \u201croll\u201d always means that you roll two six- sided dice and add their results to the value of the modifier. Some moves will have you add some other value to your roll instead of an ability modifier. I\u2019m making a move that asks me to roll+STR and my STR modifier is +1. I rolled two six-sided dice, got a one and a four. My total is six. The results always fall into three basic categories. A total of 10 or higher (written 10+) is the best outcome. A total of 7\u20139 is still a success but it comes with compromises or cost. A 6 or lower is trouble, but you also get to mark XP. Each move will tell you what happens on a 10+ and a 7\u20139. Most moves won\u2019t say what happens on a 6-, that\u2019s up to the GM but you also always mark XP. Damage rolls work a little differently. They use different dice depending on who or what is dealing damage Result Outcome 10+ You do it with little trouble 7-9 You do it with complications or trouble 6- The GM says what happens Moves and Equipment The most important role of a character\u2019s equipment is to help describe the moves they make. A character without a weapon of some sort isn\u2019t going to trigger the hack and slash move when fighting a dragon since a bare-knuckle punch really doesn\u2019t do much to inch-thick scales. It doesn\u2019t count for the purposes of triggering the move. Likewise, sometimes equipment will avoid triggering a move. Climbing a sheer icy cliff is usually defying danger, but with a good set of climbing gear you might be able to avoid the imminent danger or calamity that triggers the move. Weapons are particularly likely to modify what moves you can trigger. A character with a dagger can easily stab the goblin gnawing on his leg, triggering hack and slash, but the character with a halberd is going to have a much harder time bringing it to bear on such a close foe. Items and gear of every sort have tags. Tags are terms to describe things. Some tags have a specific effect on the rules (things like damage reduction on armor or a magical bonus to a particular kind of move or stat). Other tags are purely about the fiction (like the close tag, which describes the length of a weapon and how near your enemies need to be for you to attack them). Tags help you describe your character\u2019s actions when the items are being used and they give the GM information about how the items you\u2019re using might go wrong or cause complications when you fail a roll. The Effects of Moves The effects of moves are always about the fictional world the characters inhabit. A 10+ on hack and slash doesn\u2019t just mean the mechanical effects, it means you successfully attacked something and did some type of harm to it. Once you\u2019ve figured out what the effects of the move are, apply them to the fiction and go back to the conversation. Always return to what\u2019s going on in the game. Some moves have immediate mechanical effects, like dealing damage or giving someone a bonus to their next roll. These effects are always a reflection of the fictional world the characters are in; make sure to use the fiction when describing the effects of the move. Some Moves\u2026 \u2026Use the phrase \u201cdeal damage.\u201d Dealing damage means you roll the damage dice for your class; sometimes your weapon will add or subtract damage too. You use your damage dice any time you make an attack that could reasonably hurt your target. Usually that means you\u2019re wielding a weapon, but your fists can be weapons with the right training or an interesting situation \u2026Say \u201ctake +1 forward.\u201d That means to take +1 to your next move roll (not damage). The bonus can be greater than +1, or even a penalty, like -1. There also might be a condition, such as \u201ctake +1 forward to hack and slash,\u201d in which case the bonus applies only to the next time you roll hack and slash, not any other move. \u2026Say \u201ctake +1 ongoing.\u201d That means to take +1 to all move rolls (not damage). The bonus can be larger than +1, or it can be a penalty, like -1. There also might be a condition, such as \u201ctake +1 ongoing to volley.\u201d An ongoing bonus also says what causes it to end, like \u201cuntil you dismiss the spell\u201d or \u201cuntil you atone to your deity.\u201d \u2026Give you \u201chold.\u201d Hold is currency that allows you to make some choices later on by spending the hold as the move describes. Hold is always saved up for the move that generated it; you can\u2019t spend your hold from defend on trap expert or vice versa, for example. \u2026Present a choice. The choice you make, like all move effects, dictates things that happen in the fiction in addition to any more mechanical effects. The choice you make on the 10+ result of hack and slash to deal more damage at the cost of opening yourself up is exactly what\u2019s happening to your character: they have enough advantage that they can stay safe or push their luck. \u2026Give you a chance to say something about your character and their history. When you spout lore you may get asked how you know the information that the GM reveals. Take that opportunity to contribute to the game and show who your character really is. Just keep in mind the established facts and don\u2019t contradict anything that\u2019s already been described. \u2026Say \u201cmark XP.\u201d That means you add one to your current XP total. Types of moves [[Basic moves]] are the bread and butter of the adventurer\u2019s life. They cover situations likely to come up in fights, tense negotiations, and dangerous areas. [[Special moves]] come up a little more rarely. They cover things like gaining a level, taking a long journey, or returning to town between adventures. [[Journey moves]] come up whenever you are travelling from one destination to another. They cover travel on safe, explored routes, as well as travel and survival in unexplored lands. All player characters have all the basic and special moves. Each player character will also have some moves from their class\u2014we\u2019ll get to those later. Each move is presented here starting with its name, then the rules of the move. Some are also accompanied by a quick discussion of how to use the move and some examples of the move being used in play.","title":"Moves"},{"location":"Moves/#making-moves","text":"Moves are rules that tell you when they trigger and what effect they have.

A total of 7\u20139 is still a success but it comes with compromises or cost. A 6 or lower is trouble, but you also get to mark XP. Each move will tell you what happens on a 10+ and a 7\u20139. Most moves won\u2019t say what happens on a 6-, that\u2019s up to the GM but you also always mark XP. Damage rolls work a little differently. They use different dice depending on who or what is dealing damage Result Outcome 10+ You do it with little trouble 7-9 You do it with complications or trouble 6- The GM says what happens","title":"Moves and dice"},{"location":"Moves/#moves-and-equipment","text":"The most important role of a character\u2019s equipment is to help describe the moves they make. A character without a weapon of some sort isn\u2019t going to trigger the hack and slash move when fighting a dragon since a bare-knuckle punch really doesn\u2019t do much to inch-thick scales. It doesn\u2019t count for the purposes of triggering the move. Likewise, sometimes equipment will avoid triggering a move. Climbing a sheer icy cliff is usually defying danger, but with a good set of climbing gear you might be able to avoid the imminent danger or calamity that triggers the move. Weapons are particularly likely to modify what moves you can trigger. A character with a dagger can easily stab the goblin gnawing on his leg, triggering hack and slash, but the character with a halberd is going to have a much harder time bringing it to bear on such a close foe. Items and gear of every sort have tags. Tags are terms to describe things. Some tags have a specific effect on the rules (things like damage reduction on armor or a magical bonus to a particular kind of move or stat). Other tags are purely about the fiction (like the close tag, which describes the length of a weapon and how near your enemies need to be for you to attack them). Tags help you describe your character\u2019s actions when the items are being used and they give the GM information about how the items you\u2019re using might go wrong or cause complications when you fail a roll.","title":"Moves and Equipment"},{"location":"Moves/#the-effects-of-moves","text":"The effects of moves are always about the fictional world the characters inhabit. A 10+ on hack and slash doesn\u2019t just mean the mechanical effects, it means you successfully attacked something and did some type of harm to it.

Death knows and sees all and tailors his bargains accordingly. This is a trade, remember. Offer something that will be a challenge to play out but will lead the game in fun new direction.

The key thing to remember is that a brush with death, succeed or fail, is a significant moment that should always lead to change. Encumbrance When you make a move while carrying weight you may be encumbered. If your weight carried is: - Equal to or less than your Load, you suffer no penalty - Less than or equal to your Load+2, you take -1 ongoing until you lighten your burden - Greater than your Load+2, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll at -1, or automatically fail A PC\u2019s Load stat is determined by their class and Str. Being able to haul more is a clear benefit when trying to carry treasure out of a dungeon or just making sure you can bring along what you need. This move only applies to things a person could walk around with and still act. Carrying a boulder on your back is not encumbrance\u2014you can\u2019t really act or move much with it. It affects what moves you can make appropriately in the fiction. End of Session When you reach the end of a session, choose one of your bonds that you feel is resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the bond with if they agree. If they do, mark XP and write a new bond with whomever you wish. Once bonds have been updated look at your alignment. If you fulfilled that alignment at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these three questions as a group: - Did we learn something new and important about the world? - Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy? - Did we loot a memorable treasure? For each \u201cyes\u201d answer everyone marks XP. Level Up When you have downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or greater than) your current level+7, you can reflect on your experiences and hone your skills. - Subtract your current level+7 from your XP. - Increase your level by 1. - Choose a new advanced move from your class. - If you are the wizard, you also get to add a new spell to your spellbook. - Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change your modifier). Changing your Constitution increases your maximum and current HP. Ability scores can\u2019t go higher than 18. Carouse When you return triumphant and throw a big party, spend 100 coins and roll +1 for every extra 100 coins spent. \u2734On a 10+, choose 3. \u2734On a 7\u20139, choose 1. \u2734On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really out of hand (the GM will say how). - You befriend a useful NPC. - You hear rumors of an opportunity. - You gain useful information. - You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked. You can only carouse when you return triumphant. That\u2019s what draws the crowd of revelers to surround adventurers as they celebrate their latest haul. If you don\u2019t proclaim your success or your failure, then who would want to party with you anyway? Supply When you go to buy something with gold on hand, if it\u2019s something readily available in the settlement you\u2019re in, you can buy it at market price. If it\u2019s something special, beyond what\u2019s usually available here, or non-mundane, roll+Cha. \u2734On a 10+, you find what you\u2019re looking for at a fair price. \u2734On a 7\u20139, you\u2019ll have to pay more or settle for something that\u2019s not exactly what you wanted, but close.

After three days of rest you remove one debility of your choice. If you\u2019re under the care of a healer (magical or otherwise) you heal a debility for every two days of rest instead. Recruit When you put out word that you\u2019re looking to hire help, roll: - +1 if you make it known that your pay is generous - +1 if you make it known what you\u2019re setting out to do - +1 if you make it known that they\u2019ll get a share of whatever you find - +1 if you have a useful reputation around these parts \u2734On a 10+, you\u2019ve got your pick of a number of skilled applicants, your choice who you hire, no penalty for not taking them along. \u2734On a 7\u20139, you\u2019ll have to settle for someone close to what you want or turn them away. \u2734On a miss someone influential and ill-suited declares they\u2019d like to come along (a foolhardy youth, a loose-cannon, or a veiled enemy, for example), bring them and take the consequences or turn them away. If you turn away applicants you take -1 forward to recruit. Outstanding Warrants When you return to a civilized place in which you\u2019ve caused trouble before, roll+Cha. \u2734On a 10+, word has spread of your deeds and everyone recognizes you. \u2734On a 7\u20139, as above, and the GM chooses a complication: - The local constabulary has a warrant out for your arrest. - Someone has put a price on your head. - Someone important to you has been put in a bad spot as a result of your actions. This move is only for places where you\u2019ve caused trouble, not every patch of civilization you enter. Being publicly caught up in someone else\u2019s trouble still triggers this move. Civilization generally means the villages, towns and cities of humans, elves, dwarves, and halflings but it can also apply to any relatively lawful establishment of monstrous species, such as orcs or goblins. If the PCs have stayed in a place as part of the community, it counts as civilization. Bolster When you spend your leisure time in study, meditation, or hard practice, you gain preparation. If you prepare for a week or more, take 1 preparation. If you prepare for a month or longer, take 3 instead. When your preparation pays off spend 1 preparation for +1 to any roll.

At any time, reveal your ploy and use Gambits to: - Add +1 to anyone\u2019s roll (Cost: 1) - Deal your damage to an enemy (Cost: 2) - Create an obstacle or distraction that a single enemy has to deal with before they can do anything else (Cost: 3) - The GM will help you reveal a trap, ambush, or plan that gives you and your allies a surprising advantage (Cost: 4) Multiple Gambits can be used and the effects stack. After the end of a battle or when it makes sense, your Gambit count resets to 0. War Knowledge When you Spout Lore about combat topics such as historical battles, military figures, martial weapons or armor, take +1. Battle of Wits You always know in which goblet resides the poison. When an enemy is watching you and there\u2019s a difficult choice to make, the GM will tell you what the enemy expects you to do.

Block and Strike Add your shield\u2019s armor to your damage. Additionally, when you wield a shield in Reactive Stance, you can roll +STR for Counterattacks instead. Battle Leader Take +1 when you Order Hirelings. Often, Hirelings will accept your training as payment for their services. Reckless Aggression When you\u2019re using Reckless Tactics, your melee attacks gain +2 Piercing. When you\u2019re using Aggressive Tactics, always roll damage twice and take the better result. Combat Sight When you\u2019re using Cautious Tactics and you Defy Danger, on a 10+ you gain a Gambit. When you\u2019re using Reactive Tactics and you Counterattack, on a 10+ you can ask the GM one question from the Discern Realities list. Intelligent Defense When you use your knowledge and training to decide the best defense, you can use the Defend move with INT instead of CON. Furthermore, when you\u2019re using Defensive Tactics, you can always spend 1 Gambit to halve an attack\u2019s effect or damage directed at you or something you Defend. Battlefield Motivation When you rally your allies in the midst of battle, spend 1 Gambit. Your allies can ignore the effects of a single debility (their choice) until the debility is made worse or the end of the battle. Optionally, you may choose to do this without spending a Gambit, but you draw unwanted attention to yourself (the GM will tell you how). Risky Gambit When you tell an ally to do something obviously dangerous and they are put in a spot, gain +1 Gambit. Misdirection When you have an enemy\u2019s attention, you can spend 2 Gambits to let an ally make a free attack (as if they rolled a 10+) against the enemy. Playing the Long Game At the end of a battle (or when it makes sense) and your Gambit count would reset to 0, you can keep 1 Gambit instead. Multiclass Learner Get one move from another class (excluding Called Shot and Backstab). Treat your level as one lower for choosing the move. When you select this move, tell everyone the story of how you came to learn it. Phase 2 When you kill an enemy, you may immediately Change Tactics for free. When you gain a level from 6-10, choose from these or the level 2-5 moves. Lethal Gambit You can spend 3 Gambits to add +1d10 Damage to anyone\u2019s attack. Ambush Master When you and your allies set up a surprise attack or trap, designate a number of Strikers up to your INT modifier (Min: 1, Max: 3). A Striker can be yourself, an ally, or a trap object. The first time each Striker deals damage, they can roll twice and take the better result. Combat Assessment This question is added to your Discern Realities list of choices: - \u201cWhat mistake has my enemy made that I can exploit?\u201d When you Change Tactics, on a 12+, you may ask this question for free Self Defense Training When you know the enemy you\u2019re about to fight, you can spend an hour or two training your allies on how best to Defy Danger. The GM will tell you which stat modifier to use, it\u2019s up to you to explain why it\u2019s effective. When you or an ally uses Defy Danger with that method against the enemy, they get an additional +1 to the roll. Such training needs to be practiced daily to be effective. All Part of the Plan Spend 2 Gambit to negate the damage of any attack. Battlefield Desperation Requires: Battlefield Motivation When you use Battlefield Motivation, you rally your allies so well that instead of just ignoring a single debility\u2019s effects, the debility turns into a +1 bonus for that modifier instead (this modifier cannot go above +3). This lasts until the debility is made worse or the end of the battle. Command Ally Replaces: Misdirection You can spend 2 Gambits to let an ally make a free attack (as if they rolled a 10+) against an enemy. You may spend an additional Gambit to maximize the damage. Surprise Attack Choose either Called Shot (Ranger) or Backstab (Thief). You gain this move. If there is already a Ranger or Thief, when you spend a few moments coordinating to use the move at the same time, they can add your +INT modifier to the damage of their first attack (in addition to any other bonuses).

This Technique can have 3 tags. Examples: Thunderclap (Blast, 2 Piercing, Forceful), Shadow Orb (Projectile, Burst, Hazard) Dual Conduits Choose another element. With a grunt or a snap of the fingers, you can toggle your Primary Element to this second element, or vice versa. Only one of the two elements can be considered your Primary Element at a time. Your Techniques are the same and use the same tags, but the element changes. My Body is Ready When you have a few minutes to concentrate without interruption, you can end your concentration by unleashing a Channel that is an automatic success. Teleport You gain access to the \u201cTeleport\u201d Technique tag. When a Technique has this tag, you instantly move somewhere Near. Describe what it looks like.

When you Hack and Slash and roll a 10+, you can add 1 Technique tag to the attack.

Fissure Requires: Thread the Needle When you use Thread the Needle, you can choose to roll up to three bonus damage dice (1d4, 2d4, or 3d4). For each roll that is a 1 or 2, you are also hurt by the bonus damage from that roll (ignores armor). Area Burst You gain access to the \u201cBurst\u201d Technique tag. When a Technique has this tag, it affects up to 3 targets nearby each other. If it deals damage, roll once and apply to each target.

Devastation Wave Requires: Signature Technique When you use your Signature Technique, you may choose to temporarily add a fourth tag, but you take 1d4 damage (ignores armor) when it\u2019s channeled. Osmosis Requires: Reabsorb Elemental When you use Reabsorb Elemental and roll a 10+, your body heals 1d6 damage. Fallout When you kill an en enemy by using Channel, the body becomes a Hazard. Corporeal Trauma When you deal damage, you can choose to suffer a debility of your choice to reroll any or all of your damage dice. If you already have all six debilities, this move cannot be used. Affliction When you Channel and roll 12+, choose something on your target (an item, a limb, a weapon). It melts, freezes, it\u2019s corrupted or encased, or whatever makes sense for your primary element. Don\u2019t Blink Requires: Teleport Techniques with the \u201cTeleport\u201d tag can now be used on other targets. Conduit Champion Replaces: Conduit Warrior Your Primary Element engulfs your body and the weapons you wield.

Spend 1 Power to keep the corpse together or the appendage will be destroyed. Piece of Mind When you or an Animated Corpse eats part of a sentient creature\u2019s brain, the GM will tell you an interesting piece of knowledge the creature possessed. Curse When you use dark magic to curse someone or something, tell the GM what you\u2019re trying to achieve. Curses are always possible, but the GM will give you one to four conditions, such as: - It requires the blood of . - It will require a lot of money - You\u2019ll need a rare component - The best you can do is a lesser or limited version - It will take days/weeks/months before the curse takes effect - will know or hear about it - You\u2019ll need to travel to ___ Replacement Parts Your knowledge of stitching together corpses allows you to reattach body parts, such as severed limbs, eyeballs, or teeth.

Wizard Spells Cantrips You prepare all of your cantrips every time you prepare spells without having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells. Light (Cantrip) An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel, but it is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence. Unseen Servant (Cantrip, Ongoing) You conjure a simple invisible construct that can do nothing but carry items. It has Load 3 and carries anything you hand to it. It cannot pick up items on its own and can only carry those you give to it. Items carried by an unseen servant appear to float in the air a few paces behind you. An unseen servant that takes damage or leaves your presence is immediately dispelled, dropping any items it carried. Otherwise the unseen servant serves you until you end the spell. Prestidigitation (Cantrip) You perform minor tricks of true magic. If you touch an item as part of the casting you can make cosmetic changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool it, warm it, flavor it, or change its color. If you cast the spell without touching an item you can instead create minor illusions no bigger than yourself. Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly illusions\u2014they won\u2019t fool anyone, but they might entertain them. Contact Spirits (Level 1, Summoning) Name the spirit you wish to contact (or leave it to the GM). You pull that creature through the planes, just close enough to speak to you. It is bound to answer any one question you ask to the best of its ability. Detect Magic (Level 1, Divination) One of your senses is briefly attuned to magic. The GM will tell you what here is magical. Telepathy (Level 1, Divination, ongoing) You form a telepathic bond with a single person you touch, enabling you to converse with that person through your thoughts. You can only have one telepathic bond at a time. Charm Person (Level 1, Enchantment, ongoing) The person (not beast or monster) you touch while casting this spell counts you as a friend until they take damage or you prove otherwise. Invisibility (Level 1, Illusion, Ongoing) Touch an ally: nobody can see them. They\u2019re invisible! The spell persists until the target attacks or you dismiss the effect. While the spell is ongoing you can\u2019t cast a spell. Magic Missile (Level 1, Evocation) Projectiles of pure magic spring from your fingers. Deal 2d4 damage to one target. Alarm (Level 1) Walk a wide circle as you cast this spell. Until you prepare spells again your magic will alert you if a creature crosses that circle. Even if you are asleep, the spell will shake you from your slumber. Dispel Magic (Level 3) Choose a spell or magic effect in your presence: this spell rips it apart. spells are ended, powerful magic is just reduced or dampened Visions Through Time (Level 3, Divination) Cast this spell and gaze into a reflective surface to see into the depths of time. The GM will reveal the details of a grim portent to you\u2014a bleak event that will come to pass without your intervention. They\u2019ll tell you something useful about how you can interfere with the grim portent\u2019s dark outcomes. Rare is the portent that claims \u201cYou\u2019ll live happily ever after.\u201d Sorry. Fireball (Level 3, Evocation) You evoke a mighty ball of flame that envelops your target and everyone nearby, inflicting 2d6 damage which ignores armor. Mimic (Level 3, Ongoing) You take the form of someone you touch while casting this spell. Your physical characteristics match theirs exactly but your behavior may not. This change persists until you take damage or choose to return to your own form. While this spell is ongoing you lose access to all your wizard moves. Mirror Image (Level 3, Illusion) You create an illusory image of yourself. When you are attacked, roll a d6. On a 4, 5, or 6 the attack hits the illusion instead, the image then dissipates and the spell ends. Sleep (Level 3, Enchantment) 1d4 enemies you can see of the GM\u2019s choice fall asleep. Only creatures capable of sleeping are affected. They awake as normal: loud noises, jolts, pain. Cage (Level 5, Evocation, Ongoing) The target is held in a cage of magical force. Nothing can get in or out of the cage. The cage remains until you cast another spell or dismiss it. While the spell is ongoing, the caged creature can hear your thoughts and you cannot leave sight of the cage. Contact Other Plane (Level 5, Divination) You send a request to another plane. Specify who or what you\u2019d like to contact by location, type of creature, name, or title. You open a two-way communication with that creature. Your communication can be cut off at any time by you or the creature you contacted. Polymorph (Level 5, Enchantment) Your touch reshapes a creature entirely, they stay in the form you craft until you cast a spell. Describe the new shape you craft, including any stat changes, significant adaptations, or major weaknesses. The GM will then tell you one or more of these: - The form will be unstable and temporary - The creature\u2019s mind will be altered as well - The form has an unintended benefit or weakness Summon Monster (Level 5, Summoning, Ongoing) A monster appears and aids you as best it can. Treat it as your character, but with access to only the basic moves. It has +1 modifier for all stats, 1 HP, and uses your damage dice.

The creature remains on this plane until it dies or you dismiss it. While the spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell. Dominate (Level 7, Enchantment, Ongoing) Your touch pushes your mind into someone else\u2019s. You gain 1d4 hold. Spend one hold to make the target take one of these actions: - Speak a few words of your choice - Give you something they hold - Make a concerted attack on a target of your choice - Truthfully answer one question If you run out of hold the spell ends. If the target takes damage you lose 1 hold. While the spell is ongoing you cannot cast a spell. True Seeing (Level 7, Divination, Ongoing) You see all things as they truly are. This effect persists until you tell a lie or dismiss the spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell. Shadow Walk (Level 7, Illusion) The shadows you target with this spell become a portal for you and your allies. Name a location, describing it with a number of words up to your level. Stepping through the portal deposits you and any allies present when you cast the spell at the location you described. The portal may only be used once by each ally. Contingency (Level 7, Evocation) Choose a 5th level or lower spell you know. Describe a trigger condition using a number of words equal to your level. The chosen spell is held until you choose to unleash it or the trigger condition is met, whichever happens first. You don\u2019t have to roll for the held spell, it just takes effect. You may only have a single contingent spell held at a time; if you cast Contingency while you have a held spell, the new held spell replaces the old one. Cloudkill (Level 7, Summoning, Ongoing) A cloud of fog drifts into this realm from beyond the Black Gates of Death, filling the immediate area.

Antipathy (Level 9, Enchantment, Ongoing) Choose a target and describe a type of creature or an alignment. Creatures of the specified type or alignment cannot come within sight of the target. If a creature of the specified type does find itself within sight of the target, it immediately flees. This effect continues until you leave the target\u2019s presence or you dismiss the spell. While the spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell. Alert (Level 9, Divination) Describe an event. The GM will tell you when that event occurs, no matter where you are or how far away the event is. If you choose, you can view the location of the event as though you were there in person. You can only have one Alert active at a time. Soul Gem (Level 9) You trap the soul of a dying creature within a gem. The trapped creature is aware of its imprisonment but can still be manipulated through spells, parley, and other effects. All moves against the trapped creature are at +1. You can free the soul at any time but it can never be recaptured once freed. Shelter (Level 9, Evocation, Ongoing) You create a structure out of pure magical power. It can be as large as a castle or as small as a hut, but is impervious to all non-magical damage. The structure endures until you leave it or you end the spell. Perfect Summons (Level 9, Summoning) You teleport a creature to your presence. Name a creature or give a short description of a type of creature. If you named a creature, that creature appears before you. If you described a type of creature, a creature of that type appears before you.","title":"The Wizard"},{"location":"Character%20playbooks/The%20Wizard/#stats","text":"Your maximum HP is 4+Constitution.
