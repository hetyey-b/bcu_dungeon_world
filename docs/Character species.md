## Human

This world is always one step from the precipice, and yet humanity endures. We are not as strong as the Orcs, nor as graceful as the Elves. We cannot match the heartiness of the Dwarves, and unlike the Drakarn, we live short, brutal lives. But who can match our diversity? Who can adapt to this cruel world as well as we? Humanity has spread from sea to mountain, from desert to swamp. In the midst of every forest, you will find a village that somehow manages to scrape by and survive. This is what it means to be human.

### Special move: Human plasticity

When creating a character, you may choose to take a Starting Move from any class playbook not already in use. However, one of your existing Starting Moves becomes an Advanced Move (you lose it, but you can choose it later when you level up). The GM will ask you how you came to learn the ability.

## Dwarf

You must always remember the sacrifice at Mount Athûn. Remember the defeat. Remember the triumph. Do not expect others to understand. They will blame you for the appearance of the demonkin and say that it was the Dwarves who unleashed horror upon the land. It is true we delved deeply, but know it was hell itself that clawed up through the earth to meet our tunnels.

### Special move: Dwarven battlebond

The sacrifice of Mount Athûn has united the Dwarven people. When you meet another dwarf, they always treat you as a trusted ally as long as you do the same.

## Elf

Where are you? We are gone now, you know this. The time of the Elves has passed. Why did you stay? This world belongs to darkness and shadow. Even our people could not hope to shine light into the world. The corruption was seeping into our forests, could you not feel it? Our highland kin say the taint of evil was even spreading to their soil. This world is doomed. And so the elvish fleet set sail one last time. May we find peace across the sea.

### Special move: Elvish artifact

When the other elves sailed across the sea, they left you a powerful weapon or item. It is one of the last known elvish artifacts. Work with the GM to create this item (it should have above average stats or possibly even magical properties), then name it.

## Tusker

It is not wise to underestimate a tusker. Behind our calm demeanor is an intensity. Look deeply and you will see, as if we were sitting by firelight, a dancing flame of fury reflected in our eyes. To awaken a tusker’s temper is to beckon unto death.

### Special move: Berserker tusker

When you’re below 10 HP, you can choose one damage die to reroll per attack

## Halfling

They call us weak! They call us tiny! Runty! Insubstantial! Pint-sized! Bah! Even the common name for our people “halfling” makes us seem lesser. But we are none of these! We have within us potential for true power! We must only seize the opportunity.

### Special move: Halfling power

At character creation, choose your preferred type of power: Wealth, Knowledge, Fear, or Social Status. When you Parley using your preferred type of power as leverage, always treat 7-9 as 10+

## Drakarn

You may think us a proud people, but those that look deep enough to pierce our pride will see our eyes filled with sorrow. We are dying. No, not of age, time only makes us stronger. Not of disease, for our blood remains pure. But yet, we, our people, grow fewer in number every time another drakarn is laid to rest. Dark memories haunt every female drakarn, of eggs turning to dust with a touch, or worse, hatching unspeakable horrors. The eldest of us, as few as they are, speak of the Broodmother, she who gave life to us all, she who slumbers in a forgotten place, she who knows the secrets of our infertility. And so we wander the world, and search. May she be found before there is no one left to look.

## Special move: Drakarn Broodmate

You have met all other drakarn. When you come across one, the GM will tell you useful information about them or ask you to come up with some.

## Special move: Flamegut

When you belch, two things catch fire. Choose one. The GM chooses the other.

## Infernal

The hot blood of a demon flows through you. Was it your father that made the bargain? Your mother? Was it you who chose the dark pact? Do not speak, you need not answer. I am not here to pass judgment. I see your horns have grown in splendidly. Do not be ashamed of them. Others will say they are the mark of true evil. They will call you fiend and hellspawn. But their words do not hold power. There is a will inside you, and it is more powerful than most. Whether they call you good, or evil, or psychotic, it matters not.

### Special move: Infernal temptation

When you tempt someone and they act against their nature, alignment, or conscience, take +1 forward.

## Kobold

All will bow to the glory of Saranak! We are but his humble servants! Forever shall we serve his dark purp—oh he’s gone? FINALLY. Alright, soft-scales, listen up! We haven’t gotten long before the big guy gets back. I heard from Seven-Tooth that you’ve been planning some kind of mutiny. Let me guess, you’re thinking we just kill this Saranak lunatic and take his stuff. Well, let me ask you this. Have you ever heard the phrase, knowledge is weakness? No? That’s because it’s the stupidest thing a kobold could say! We’re here because Saranak knows things. And where there’s knowledge, there’s power! Lucky for you, we’ve learned about everything we can here. Hey Seven-Tooth! Yeah, you! Get that tripline set up for when Sara-whatever gets back. We’re leaving!

### Special move: Kobold trapper

When you construct a trap, roll. If you have...

* ...the appropriate materials, take +1
* ...help from others, take +1
* ...constructed it slowly and safely, take +1
  On 10+, it works flawlessly. On a 7-9, it works! Sort of...

## Firbolg

The clans may be scattered now, but I remember a time of glory! I told you stories of Lorna the Brute. Now there was a warrior! She must have been 8 feet tall with limbs the size of a horse’s neck. It’s no wonder she was clanmaster for two decades. I know what they say. That it was only her savage methods that kept the clans united. It’s true she saw fear as the only true motivator. And I won’t deny the world now sees us as barbarians. Maybe they’re right to think as much.

### Special move: Firbolg wrestling

When you grapple with someone smaller than you, roll+STR. On a 7+, you pin them. On a 10+, you may deal your damage.
