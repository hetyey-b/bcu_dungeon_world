Long silk rope with red and silver inlays. Can move on its own, and take simple commands. More complex ones need a Roll+Cha (?).

10+ - The rope understands and executes the order the best it can

7-9 - Pick one:

* It takes longer then you'd like
* It'll work but not for long
* Instructions unclear, it produces something close
