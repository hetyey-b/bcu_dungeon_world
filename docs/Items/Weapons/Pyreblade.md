The *Flame of the Wild Lands* was a member of the [Order of the Forever Flame](../../The%20Campaign/Organisations/Order%20of%20the%20Forever%20Flame.md). His sword is called Pyreblade.

It is a bastard sword, being able to be wielded one or two handed. The pommel is missing a gem from it's socket, so it's only a ring.

You may at any point call upon the *Flame of the Wild Lands*'s spirit, which sets the blade aflame. This lasts until you dismiss the effect, the sword is doused by water, it leaves your hand, or you are knocked unconscious. (This ability can be used only once. It recharges when the light of the rising sun shines on the blade.)

When you hack and slash with this sword, you may forgo dealing damage, and instead set something your opponent is holding or wearing aflame. If your opponent is flammable, you may set them alight as well. On a 10+, you may set something on fire, and still deal regular damage.
