## Description

Basically a spear or other polearm, with a bamboo/wooden/metal tube attached to it's side. It is filled with gunpowder, (and optionally fragmentation projectiles) and lit with a slow burning match. It is a combination of a shotgun and a flamethrower, but with a very limited, around 3 meter range.

## Stats

* Works like a spear (reach, thrown, near), but has more weight and cost (2 weight, 100 coins), and reload.
* When the fire lance part is used, roll Volley. On a 7-9, you can't choose to mark off ammo, when shot, always mark one off. (as with thrown weapons) You can choose (on a 7-9) the following effect: `you mistime the shot, it fires earlier, or later then you had hoped. GM will tell you how this affects the fight, but you still deal damage to your target.`
* When loading the fire lance tube, you can choose whether you add shrapnel. If you do, it gains the Messy tag. If you don't, the gunpowder bursts forth in a giant ball of flame, which can set everything in your targeting range on fire.
* The fire lance shot works to a distance of about 3 meters.
