## Death Move: Shatter Bars, Cleave Gates

*When you die (you fail, or forgo your Last Breath) you can use this move*

When you finally fall, you make sure someone’s coming with you. With every last bit of strength you have in your weary bones, you make a final, ultimate strike. When you die, choose any enemy you can see and deal double your maximum damage to them. This attack does not stop at your target - everything between you and your target, as well as everything directly behind your target out to Far range, is also hit. 

If you were using a bladed weapon, you create a rending scar, tearing through everything in its path. If you were using a bashing weapon, you create a crushing quake, shattering everything in its path. If you were using a stabbing weapon, you create a gouging hole, piercing through everything in its path. With this final blow completed, you collapse, very much dead.

### Alternative Death Move: Legendary Weapon

*When your Death Move would trigger, you may choose to use your Alternative Death Move instead.*

There it is to your side; your best friend, your life, your weapon. Your weapon, that without you, was useless. Without your weapon, you were useless. You are soulbound to this weapon; with your last breath you grasp it and take your last stand. You automatically fully succeed on one Hack & Slash or Defend roll, before you finally fall. Your signature weapon now contains your soul; it becomes a magical weapon retaining 2 of its enhancements, and gaining one new magical effect.

Its magical effects should be related to what you desired or stood for in life; Work with the GM to decide its power. This Legendary Weapon will be forever bloodstained; within lies your sleeping soul, waiting to be awakened.
