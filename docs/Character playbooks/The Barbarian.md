## Starting moves

*Choose one of these to start with:*

### Full Plate and Packing Steel

You ignore the clumsy tag on armor you wear.

### Unencumbered, Unharmed

So long as you are below your Load and neither wear armor nor carry a shield, take +1 armor.

*You also start with all of the following Starting moves:*

### Herculean Appetites

Others may content themselves with just a taste of wine, or dominion over a servant or two, but you want more. Choose two appetites. While pursuing one of your appetites if you would roll for a move, instead of rolling 2d6 you roll 1d6+1d8. If the d6 is the higher die of the pair, the GM will also introduce a complication or danger that comes about due to your heedless pursuits.

* Pure destruction
* Power over others
* Mortal pleasures
* Conquest
* Riches and property
* Fame and glory

### The Upper Hand

You take +1 ongoing to last breath rolls. When you take your last breath, on a 7–9 you make an offer to Death in return for your life. If Death accepts he will return you to life. If not, you die.

### Musclebound

While you wield a weapon it gains the forceful and messy tags.

### What Are You Waiting For?

When you cry out a challenge to your enemies, roll+Con. ✴On a 10+ they treat you as the most obvious threat to be dealt with and ignore your companions, take +2 damage ongoing against them. ✴On a 7–9 only a few (the weakest or most foolhardy among them) fall prey to your taunting.

## Alignment

### Chaotic

Eschew a convention of the civilized world.

### Neutral

Teach someone the ways of your people.

## Gear

Your Load is 8+Str. You carry dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight), a dagger (hand, 1 weight) some token of where you’ve travelled or where you’re from, and your choice of weapon:

Choose one:

* Adventuring gear (1 weight) and dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight)

## Bonds

Fill in the name of one of your companions in at least one:

\_\_\_\_\_\_ is puny and foolish, but amusing to me.

\_\_\_\_\_\_'s ways are strange and confusing.

\_\_\_\_\_\_ is always getting into trouble—I must protect them from themselves.

\_\_\_\_\_\_ shares my hunger for glory; the earth will
tremble at our passing!

## Death Move: A Good Day to Die

*When you die (you fail, or forgo your Last Breath) you can use this move*

There is that tranquil moment, before death, where everything slows to a crawl. Most waste that moment, but not you. No, you seize that moment and do not let go. When you die, you enter a deathless fury. For about a minute (to you), nothing else can move or take any actions at all, and you can do anything you want unopposed. 

When your time is up, only a moment has passed for everyone else, and the results of your actions all take effect at once. After one last line or a bellowing laugh or both, you die.

## Advanced moves

*When you gain a level from 2–5, choose from these moves.*

### Still Hungry

Choose an additional appetite.

### Appetite for Destruction

Take a move from the fighter, bard or thief class list. You may not take multiclass moves from those classes.

### My Love For You Is Like a Truck

When you perform a feat of strength, name someone present whom you have impressed and take +1 forward to parley with them.

### What Is Best In Life

At the end of a session, if during this session you have crushed your enemies, seen them driven before you, or have heard the lamentations of their kinfolk mark XP.

### Wide-Wanderer

You’ve travelled the wide world over. When you arrive someplace ask the GM about any important traditions, rituals, and so on, they’ll tell you what you need to know.

### Usurper

When you prove yourself superior to a person in power, take +1 forward with their followers, underlings, and hangers on.

### Khan of Khans

Your hirelings always accept the gratuitous fulfilment of one of your appetites as payment.

### Samson

You may take a debility to immediately break free of any physical or mental restraint.

### Smash!

When you hack and slash, on a 12+ deal your damage and choose something physical your target has (a weapon, their position, a limb): they lose it.

### Indestructible Hunger

When you take damage you can choose to take -1 ongoing until you sate one of your appetites instead of taking the damage. If you already have this penalty you cannot choose this option.

### Eye for Weakness

When you discern realities add "What here is weak or vulnerable?" to the list of questions you can ask.

### On the Move

When you defy a danger caused by movement (maybe falling off a narrow bridge or rushing past an armed guard) take +1.

*When you gain a level from 6–10, choose from these moves or the level 2–5 moves.*

### A Good Day to Die

As long as you have less than your Con in current HP (or 1, whichever is higher) take +1 ongoing.

### Kill ‘em All

*Requires: Appetite for Destruction*

Take another move from the fighter, bard or thief class list. You may not take multiclass moves from those classes.

### War Cry

When you enter battle with a show of force (a shout, a rallying cry, a battle dance) roll+Cha. ✴On a 10+ both, ✴on a 7–9 one or the other.

* Your allies are rallied and take +1 forward
* Your enemies feel fear and act accordingly (avoiding you, hiding, attacking with fear-driven abandon)

### Mark of Might

When you take this move and spend some uninterrupted time reflecting on your past glories you may mark yourself with a symbol of your power (a long braid tied with bells, ritual scars or tattoos, etc.) Any intelligent mortal creature who sees this symbol knows instinctively that you are a force to be reckoned with and treats you appropriately.

### More! Always More!

When you satisfy an appetite to the extreme (destroying something unique and significant, gaining enormous fame, riches, power, etc.) you may choose to resolve it. Cross it off the list and mark XP. While you may pursue that appetite again, you no longer feel the burning desire you once did. In its place, choose a new appetite from the list or write your own.

### The One Who Knocks

When you defy danger, on a 12+ you turn the danger back on itself, the GM will describe how.

### Healthy Distrust

Whenever the unclean magic wielded by mortal men causes you to defy danger, treat any result of 6- as a 7–9.

### For the Blood God

You are initiated in the old ways, the ways of sacrifice. Choose something your gods (or the ancestor spirits, or your totem, etc) value—gold, blood, bones or the like. When you sacrifice those things as per your rites and rituals, roll+wis. ✴On a 10+ the GM will grant you insight into your current trouble or a boon to help you. ✴On a 7-9 the sacrifice is not enough and your gods take of your flesh as well, but still grant you some insight or boon. ✴On a miss, you earn the ire of the fickle spirits.
