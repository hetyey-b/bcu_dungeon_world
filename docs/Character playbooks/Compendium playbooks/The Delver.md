When you reach the lowest level of at least two different dungeons, the next time you level up you may choose to gain this move:

## Starting move

### Sniff the Air

When you use your senses to assess a subterranean area, ask the GM 2 questions from the list below.

* Which way lies the nearest danger?
* Which way lies the nearest treasure?
* Which way leads to the nearest exit?
* Which way will take me deeper?
* What lies hidden here?

## Advanced moves

*When you have taken the above move, you may take any of the following moves instead of a move from your class when you level up:*

### Pack Smart

When you mark the last use of your adventuring gear, it counts as 2 uses instead of 1—say what they both are, right now.

### Embrace the Black

When you find yourself in utter darkness underground, roll +WIS: on a 10+, hold 3; on a 7-9, hold 2; on a 6-, hold 1, mark XP, and the GM makes a move.

As long as the darkness persists, you may spend your hold, 1-for-1, to do one of the following:

* Know exactly where any one thing is in the near vicinity
* Make any one move, without suffering consequences due to the darkness
* Remain still and undetectable by mundane means until you move or make noise

### Fungivore

When you seek edible fungus and lichens underground, you may Forage. Whether or not anyone else wants to eat what you find is another matter.

### Eat the Enemy

When you clean and dress a fresh monster carcass for consumption, roll its damage and gain that many specious rations. When anyone eats a specious ration, they roll +CON: on a 10+, it’s not good... but not awful, and counts as 1 normal ration consumed; on a 7-9, it counts as a ration, but choose 1 from the list below; on a 6-, mark XP, and the GM makes a move.

* You become sick and acquire a monstrous characteristic until you recover (the GM will tell you what)
* 1D6 of your remaining specious rations have spoiled
