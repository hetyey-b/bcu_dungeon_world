When you wake up after a bender with no idea where you are or how you got there, the next time you level up you may choose to gain this move:

## Starting move

### Drink Like A Demon

When you take a swig of an alcoholic drink, roll +Con. On a 10+, you now have 3-drunkenness. On a 7-9, you have 2-drunkenness. You may reduce your drunkenness by one at any time to heal yourself of 1d4 damage.

## Advanced moves

*When you have taken the above move, you may take any of the following moves instead of a move from your class when you level up:*

### Ethanol Powered

Choose either Hack And Slash or Cast A Spell, if you have it. From now on whenever you use the move you picked, you may add +drunkenness to your roll, then immediately reduce it by 1, regardless of the result.

### Lightweight

When using Drink Like a Demon, you gain an additional +1 drunkenness.

### Seeing Double

When you Defy Danger by stumbling and lurching out of the way, roll +drunkenness.

### Iron Liver

Whenever you are resisting poison, treat a result of 7-9 as 10+, and a result of 6- as 7-9. After what you do to your body every day, poison is just a drop in the bucket.
