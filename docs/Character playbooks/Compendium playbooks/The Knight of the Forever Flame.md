When you are a drakarn, who has taken the oath of the Order of the Forever Flame, the next time you level up, you may choose to gain this move:

## Starting move

### Warrior of the Forever Flame

If you add a drop of your blood to the light of a candle or torch, that flame will burn forever, without consuming it's material, until put out.

You may use your Flamegut ability to imbue your shield, weapon, or armour with the light of the Forever Flame. You may change this at any time, but only one of them can be imbued at a time. Any enemy coming in contact with your imbued equipment takes 1d4 damage from your flames.

## Advanced moves

*When you have taken the above move, you may take any of the following moves instead of a move from your class when you level up:*

### Tunneling charge

You may roll+CON to briefly become incorporeal, and move through a solid wall no thicker then a meter, and not made of metal. You take 1d4 damage when doing so. On 10+, choose 2. On 7-9, choose 1.

* You may take up to two additional willing creatures, who are holding onto you, with you. They take 1d4 damage as well.
* You may take up to one unwilling creature you are holding onto firmly, and are strong enough to drag or carry, with you. They take 1d4 damage as well.
* You do not take damage. If you are travelling with other creatures, you may choose if they take damage from travelling damage or not.
* Your next attack against an enemy surprised by you appearing from the wall automatically hits.

### Wisdom of Elders

When you Spout Lore, you may ask the following question:

* What can the spirits of the dead knights of my order tell me about this?

### Light of Dawn

You may make your shield, weapon, armour, or other item of clothing glow with a bright sunlight. Creatures accustomed to living in the dark take -1 to any roll requiring sight while Near you. Your allies may add +1 for any Defy Danger roll while Near your light.

### Holy Calling

You may take a move from the Paladin or Templar playbooks. Treat your level as one lower, when choosing this move.
