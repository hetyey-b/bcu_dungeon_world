When you live for a week off only rations you have hunted yourself, the next time you level up you may choose to gain this move:

## Starting move

### Track

When you encounter tracks or spoor and take time to examine the scene, the GM will describe the sign, and tell you how long ago it was made. Then, you may ask the GM 2 questions about it, within reason.

## Advanced moves

*When you have taken the above move, you may take any of the following moves instead of a move from your class when you level up:*

### Stalk

When you follow a trail left by a creature in order to locate it, that creature becomes your quarry. Take +1 to any move made while pursuing, hiding from, subduing, or attacking your quarry. You may only have one quarry at a time.

### Shoot to Kill

When you roll a 10+ to Volley at a target that is unaware of your presence, deal your damage +1d6.

### Clean and Dress

When you take the time to reduce a freshly slain creature to its constituent parts as efficiently as possible, roll +INT: on a 10+, all 3 from the list below apply; on a 7-9, choose 2 from the list; on a 6-, mark XP, and choose 1.

* You extract the maximum number of edible rations from the carcass
* You preserve everything of potential value (hide, musk glands, etc.)
* You gain some insight into the creature’s history or behavior (ask the GM what)

### Hunter’s Rest

When you take the time to establish a shelter in the wild, say what it looks like, how it takes advantage of the local landscape, and roll +WIS: on a 10+, all 3 tags below apply; on a 7-9, choose 2 tags from the list; on a 6-, mark XP, and choose 1.

* Ambuscade: your shelter cannot be found by anyone who doesn’t know to look for it
* Vantage point: when anyone Stays Sharp in your shelter, they always succeed as if they rolled a 10+
* Sanctuary: when anyone Makes Camp in your shelter, they take +1

You may maintain a number of active shelters in a given region equal to your level.
