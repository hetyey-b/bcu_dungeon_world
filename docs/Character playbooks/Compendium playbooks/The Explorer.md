When you enlist the support of a powerful patron to reward your forays into the unknown, the next time you level up you may choose to gain this move:

### Patron

You have the support of a powerful individual or group, who will reward you for the delivery of certain things gathered from foreign climes. Choose 1 patron, and the thing they want:

* Church: evidence of church’s history, divine presence or opposing deity
* Guild: location and proof of materials useful to the guild
* Historian: evidence of historic events
* Jeweler: gemstones
* Magnate: evidence of natural resources and their location
* Wizard: magical items, or evidence and locations of magical places
  Your patron will provide you with supplies for any expedition you undertake on their behalf, within reason. When you deliver the desired news or goods to your patron, you are compensated. Negotiate your compensation with the GM, based on the nature of your patron.

*When you have taken the above move, you may take any of the following moves instead of a move from your class when you level up:*

### Plant Your Flag

When you claim a place in your own name or that of your patron, plant a flag or standard, and mark the place on your map. When you lead an expedition to that place, you find it unerringly, and you take +1 on-going to Hack and Slash or Defend as long as your flag is in sight. These effects apply only to the most recently claimed place.

### Thrill of Discovery

When you come upon a previously undocumented and notable Discovery, both of the following effects apply:

* The excitement of the moment grants you +1 forward
* Mark XP at the end of the session (max. once per session)
* Log Your Findings

You have a logbook or other external and portable repository of information that’s always with you. Say what it is. When you encounter a new and notable Danger or Discovery, write it down (a brief note will do). This counts as an entry in your log.

When you share your findings with one or more residents of a steading, choose an entry you want to share, and roll +CHA: on a 10+, choose 2 from the list below; on a 7-9, choose 1; on a 6-, choose 1, but the GM also makes a move.

* Someone here can tell you more about it—the GM will say who, and what they know
* Someone here is interested in this information—ask the GM who, and what they’ll offer for it in trade
* Someone here will respond strongly to this finding—ask the GM who, and whether they’ll be impressed, frightened, or otherwise affected
* Mark XP
* 

In any case, once you share a given entry, cross off that entry. You can only share an entry once.
