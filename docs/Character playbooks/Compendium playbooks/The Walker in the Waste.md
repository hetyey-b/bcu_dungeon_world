When you almost perish from thirst or heat, but make a deal for your life with a deity of the waste, the next time you level up you may choose to gain this move:

## Starting move

### Child of the Waste

You are adapted to life in the desert. Any time you roll to resist the effects of hot weather, treat a roll of 7-9 as 10+, and a roll of 6- as 7-9. You only need to consume half as much water as a regular human.

You also take +1 to Forage in deserts or wastelands, as long as they are not completely barren.

## Advanced moves

*When you have taken the above move, you may take any of the following moves instead of a move from your class when you level up:*

### Born of the Waste

*Replaces Child of the Waste*

You are immune to any effects of hot weather. You only need to consume the equivalent of one day's worth of water for a regular creature once a week to survive.

You take +2 to Forage in deserts or wastelands, as long as they are not completely barren. If they are completely barren, such as sand dunes of the desert without any vegetation, you can still find enough food to sustain yourself, but can't find anything edible to creatures who are not Walkers in the Waste.

### Flesh to Salt

When you call the essence of salt forth a target in touch range, roll + Wis. On a result of 10+, the target takes your damage, and an additional 1d4 damage that ignores armor. If this damage is more then half the remaining health of the target, their flesh starts to turn into salt, taking 1 damage (ignores armor) every time they try to move, until cured by magic, or by being fully covered in water. If they die, they turn into a pillar of salt. On a 7-9, choose one from the following list, the GM chooses another:

* You put yourself in danger, making a counter attack possible
* You don't deal the additional 1d4 damage
* Your magic does not hold, you lose the extra 1 damage a turn effect
* You anger the spirits of the desert. Lose access to Flesh to Salt until you atone to them by making an adequate sacrifice

### Plague

You may transform a handful of dust or sand into a terrible plague. While inside, or near a steading, roll + Wis. On a result of 10+, hold 3. On a result of 7-9, the same, and also choose one:

* Lose 1 hold
* Someone witnesses you - your role in starting the plague is known in the steading
* The plague affects someone nearby (including possibly yourself) you did not intend to target. The GM will tell you who

Choose the type of the plague on the first day from the list below. While it is active, you may not call forth another plague. Every day after the day you cast your plague, choose the nature of it for the day from the list below.

* Locusts: The steading loses 1 Prosperity
* Death of the Firstborn: The steading loses 1 Population
* Wild animals: All manner of animals surround the steading - native animals from the region, and domesticated ones, that go feral. For this day, nobody can travel in, or out of the village without great difficulty
* Blot out the sun: Inside the steading, and it's immediate surroundings, it is as if the sun didn't rise - complete darkness, and cold as at night
