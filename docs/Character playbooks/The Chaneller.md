## Starting moves

### Conduit

Within you resides a gateway to pure magic. Choose a Primary Element. Your magic is of this element.
*Flame, Frost, Shock, Shadow, Wind, Water, or* ___
Choose an Emanation Point. This is where magic leaves
your body.
*Forehead, Eyes, Mouth, Chest, Fingers, Palms, or* ___

### Channel

When you open your Conduit up wide and channel magic through your body, roll +CON. ✴On a 10+, raw magic of your Primary Element flows out of your Emanation Point. Use one of your Techniques. ✴On a 7-9, the same, but the power is too much. You can use your body as a dam and take 1d4 damage (ignores armor) or allow the power through. If you allow the power through, the GM will tell you of one or more complications, such as:

* The magic flows out of a different part of your body or is of a different element
* The magic has an unintended effect on the environment
* It causes a blast wave and you’re thrown backwards

### Summon Elemental

When you beckon inwards to call forth an Elemental being, choose any Technique tag and roll+CON. ✴On a 10+, the Elemental flows out of you and a stream of magic connects it to your Emanation Point like a leash. The Elemental’s nature and appearance wholly embodies the tag you chose. You gain 1d4 Control. ✴On a 7-9, the Elemental is also moody or troublesome, choose one:

* You must immediately spend 1 Control
* It embodies a different tag instead (the GM will tell you which)
* It resents you and will certainly be hostile later
  As long as the Elemental remains leashed, you have the Elemental Protection and Elemental Attack moves. When you have 0 Control, your elemental is released! It can act and use its tag at will, and its HP is 2x your level. Maybe it’s friendly, hostile, mischievous, or just bored.

### Trickle

You can emit a small amount of your Primary Element for mundane tasks or to impress someone without having to Channel.

### Techniques

You have special Techniques that allow limited control over the flow of magic. When you spend several hours developing a new Technique, add it to your list or replace an existing one. You can learn up to 3 Techniques. Keeping in mind your Primary Element, name the Technique and choose 2 tags:

* Projectile (1d6 damage if Near)
* Blast (1d8 damage if Close)
* 2 Piercing
* Barrier (+1 Armor until next Channel)
* Hazard (Environmental effect)
* Forceful
  Examples:
* Wind Push (Blast, Forceful)
* Earth Wall (Barrier, Hazard)
* Icy Ground (Hazard, Forceful)
* The Zapper (Projectile, 2 Piercing)

### Elemental Protection

When you or your leashed Elemental takes damage from any source, you lose 1 Control and the damage is negated.

### Elemental Attack

When you command your leashed Elemental to use its tag, roll+Control. ✴On a 10+, success. ✴On a 7-9, you also lose 1 Control.

### Neutral

## Gear

Your Load is 9+STR. You carry dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight) and a soothing balm (0 weight) that feels nice on your emanation point.
Choose one:

* Leather armor (1 armor, 1 weight)
* 3 healing potions and adventuring gear (5 uses, 1 weight)
  Choose your backup weapon:
* Knife (hand, 1 weight)
* Bō staff (close, two-handed, 1 weight)

moves.

### Thread the Needle

Your body has become almost entirely immune to your primary element. You have 5 Armor against outside damage consisting of your Primary Element.

### Bender of the Elements

Your control over your primary element extends beyond your body. When you manipulate something in the nearby environment made of your primary element, roll+CON. ✴On a 10+, hold 3. ✴On a 7-9, hold 1. So long as you do nothing but concentrate on controlling it, you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:

* It does 1d6 damage to something
* It has the Forceful tag
* It moves to a new position within sight
* It holds a particular shape (even after you stop concentrating)

### Signature Technique

You gain an additional Technique slot. This Technique can have 3 tags. Examples: Thunderclap (Blast, 2 Piercing, Forceful), Shadow Orb (Projectile, Burst, Hazard)

### Dual Conduits

Choose another element. With a grunt or a snap of the fingers, you can toggle your Primary Element to this second element, or vice versa. Only one of the two elements can be considered your Primary Element at a time. Your Techniques are the same and use the same tags, but the element changes.

### My Body is Ready

When you have a few minutes to concentrate without interruption, you can end your concentration by unleashing a Channel that is an automatic success.
