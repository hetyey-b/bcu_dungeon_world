## Stats

Your maximum HP is 10+Constitution.
Your base damage is d8.

## Starting moves

### Tactics

Your knowledge and training allows you to assess a battle and know the correct tactical approach. Only one Tactic can be active at a time.

#### Aggressive

When you Hack and Slash, deal your damage even on a 6-.

#### Cautious

Gain +1 when you Defy Danger.

#### Reactive

You cannot Hack and Slash, but you can Counterattack: When you are attacked in melee and attempt to counter, roll +DEX. ✴On a 7+, you expertly parry the attack. ✴On a 10+, you riposte and deal your damage. 

#### Defensive

When you use the Defend move, treat a 6- as a 7-9.

#### Reckless

When you deal damage, deal +1d4 damage. When you take damage, take +1d4 damage.

### Change Tactics

When you draw on your knowledge and training to assess a combat situation, roll +INT. ✴On a 10+, you formulate a plan and select a new Tactic. ✴On a 7-9, also choose one:

* The new Tactic isn’t effective at first, take -1 Forward
* An early plan lead up to this, spend 1 Gambit
* The Tactic requires that you draw attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.

### Heavy Armor Training

You ignore the clumsy tag on armor you wear.

### Gambit

When you or someone you have a bond with takes damage from an outside source, it was part of your plan the whole time, gain +1 Gambit. What some might see as an unwanted setback, you know it’s merely a stratagem to gain a later advantage. At any time, reveal your ploy and use Gambits to:

* Add +1 to anyone’s roll (Cost: 1)
* Deal your damage to an enemy (Cost: 2)
* Create an obstacle or distraction that a single enemy has to deal with before they can do anything else (Cost: 3)
* The GM will help you reveal a trap, ambush, or plan that gives you and your allies a surprising advantage (Cost: 4)

Multiple Gambits can be used and the effects stack. After the end of a battle or when it makes sense, your Gambit count resets to 0.

### War Knowledge

When you Spout Lore about combat topics such as historical battles, military figures, martial weapons or armor, take +1.

### Battle of Wits

You always know in which goblet resides the poison. When an enemy is watching you and there’s a difficult choice to make, the GM will tell you what the enemy expects you to do.

### Natural Tactician

Choose a Default Tactic. By nature you always have this Tactic active until you Change Tactics. 
*Aggressive, Cautious, Reactive, Defensive, Reckless*
You can always spend 1 Gambit to instantly return to
this Tactic.

Endanger yourself to make a plan succeed

## Bonds

Fill in the name of one of your companions in at least one:

My respect for \_\_\_\_\_\_ was earned on the
battlefield.

I can always depend on \_\_\_\_\_\_ to follow my
stratagems.

## Death Move: Grand plan

*When you die (you fail, or forgo your Last Breath) you can use this move*

It’s time. All of your preparation for this moment must finally come to fruition. When you die, your grand plan is revealed and your death proves to be the final gambit. Your allies may have known all along or maybe you kept them in the dark, knowing they wouldn’t understand.

Work with the GM to reveal this master plot. The plan should give your allies a major boon or advantage, or set up your enemies for destruction, or set major world events in motion.

Rest in peace, Battlemaster, knowing even now in death, the goals you had in life will soon be achieved.

## Advanced moves

*When you gain a level from 2-5, choose from these moves.*

### Block and Strike

Add your shield’s armor to your damage. Additionally, when you wield a shield in Reactive Stance, you can roll +STR for Counterattacks instead.

### Battle Leader

Take +1 when you Order Hirelings. Often, Hirelings will accept your training as payment for their services.

### Reckless Aggression

When you’re using Reckless Tactics, your melee attacks gain +2 Piercing. When you’re using Aggressive Tactics, always roll damage twice and take the better result.

### Combat Sight

When you’re using Cautious Tactics and you Defy Danger, on a 10+ you gain a Gambit. When you’re using Reactive Tactics and you Counterattack, on a 10+ you can ask the GM one question from the Discern Realities list.

### Intelligent Defense

When you use your knowledge and training to decide the best defense, you can use the Defend move with INT instead of CON. Furthermore, when you’re using Defensive Tactics, you can always spend 1 Gambit to halve an attack’s effect or damage directed at you or something you Defend.

### Battlefield Motivation

When you rally your allies in the midst of battle, spend 1 Gambit. Your allies can ignore the effects of a single debility (their choice) until the debility is made worse or the end of the battle. Optionally, you may choose to do this without spending a Gambit, but you draw unwanted attention to yourself (the GM will tell you how).

### Risky Gambit

When you tell an ally to do something obviously dangerous and they are put in a spot, gain +1 Gambit.

### Misdirection

When you have an enemy’s attention, you can spend 2 Gambits to let an ally make a free attack (as if they rolled a 10+) against the enemy.

### Playing the Long Game

At the end of a battle (or when it makes sense) and your Gambit count would reset to 0, you can keep 1 Gambit instead.

### Multiclass Learner

Get one move from another class (excluding Called Shot and Backstab). Treat your level as one lower for choosing the move. When you select this move, tell everyone the story of how you came to learn it.

### Phase 2

When you kill an enemy, you may immediately Change Tactics for free.

When you gain a level from 6-10, choose from these or the level 2-5 moves.

### Lethal Gambit

You can spend 3 Gambits to add +1d10 Damage to anyone’s attack.

### Ambush Master

When you and your allies set up a surprise attack or trap, designate a number of Strikers up to your INT modifier (Min: 1, Max: 3). A Striker can be yourself, an ally, or a trap object. The first time each Striker deals damage, they can roll twice and take the better result.

### Combat Assessment

This question is added to your Discern Realities list of
choices:

* “What mistake has my enemy made that I can exploit?”

*When you Change Tactics, on a 12+, you may ask this question for free*

### Self Defense Training

When you know the enemy you’re about to fight, you can spend an hour or two training your allies on how best to Defy Danger. The GM will tell you which stat modifier to use, it’s up to you to explain why it’s effective. When you or an ally uses Defy Danger with that method against the enemy, they get an additional +1 to the roll. Such training needs to be practiced daily to be effective.

### All Part of the Plan

Spend 2 Gambit to negate the damage of any attack.

### Battlefield Desperation

*Requires: Battlefield Motivation*

When you use Battlefield Motivation, you rally your allies so well that instead of just ignoring a single debility’s effects, the debility turns into a +1 bonus for that modifier instead (this modifier cannot go above +3). This lasts until the debility is made worse or the end of the battle.

### Command Ally

*Replaces: Misdirection*

You can spend 2 Gambits to let an ally make a free attack (as if they rolled a 10+) against an enemy. You may spend an additional Gambit to maximize the damage.

### Surprise Attack

Choose either Called Shot (Ranger) or Backstab (Thief). You gain this move. If there is already a Ranger or Thief, when you spend a few moments coordinating to use the move at the same time, they can add your +INT modifier to the damage of their first attack (in addition to any other bonuses).

### Tactical Teacher

You gain an additional Bond:

I will teach \_\_\_\_\_\_ to have a tactical mind.

Whoever this bond is with can choose to gain the effects
of your current Tactics.
