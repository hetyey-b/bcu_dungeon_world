## Stats

Your maximum HP is 8+Constitution.
Your base damage is d8.

## Starting moves

### Wrath Embodied

You are heavenly vengeance made manifest and Wrath is your currency. The more pure your soul, the more holy power can pass through you. If your soul is immaculate, then you have 3 Wrath (the max).

When you spend time performing your purification ritual (an uninterrupted hour or so), set your Wrath to the max.

### Penance

When you quickly perform penance, take 1d4 damage (ignores armor) and gain 1 Wrath. Penance is self-punishment, such as tightening a cilice, using a whip or knout, or other forms of mortification of the flesh. This type of brutal penance might be painful, but it’s the only way to purify your soul quickly, such as in the midst of a battle.

### Smite

When you Hack and Slash, on a 10+ you may spend a Wrath to deal +1d4 extra damage.

### Divine Force

When you Volley, on a 10+ you may spend a Wrath to forcefully knock back all enemies who are close by to where your volley landed.

### Blinding Light

When you Defy Danger, on a 10+ you may spend a Wrath to emit an immensely bright holy light that temporarily blinds your attacker.

### Consecrated Ground

When you Defend, on a 10+ you may spend a Wrath to consecrate the ground around you. When an enemy first enters consecrated ground, they take damage equal to your level.

### Confession

When you hear someone else confess a sinful act or wrongdoing, you can grant them absolution. The confession can be a recent action or something that happened in the character’s past. Roll +CHA. ✴On a 10+, they are healed for 1d8 damage. ✴On a 7-9, they are healed, but the confession sullies your mind and you must immediately perform penance, take 1d4 damage (ignores armor).

### Inquisitor

When you hold a captive for questioning, roll+CHA. 

* On a 7+, the captive (the GM) will tell you three statements: two are true, but one is a lie. 
* On a 10+, the GM will tell you one of the three statements that is definitely true (leaving the 2 unknown statements). If you choose to press the captive further, pick a statement that you guess to be the lie. Your methods cause significant emotional or physical scars, but if you picked the lie correctly, the captive will break and truthfully answer any questions you ask. 
* On a 6-, they won’t break, or they hold back, or something went very, very wrong. Oops.

### Facets of Inquisition

There are many facets of inquisition, choose one you favor:

* Fear
  +1 to Parley when the character fears you
* Surprise
  +1 Piercing against surprised enemies
* Ruthless Efficiency
  When Manage Provisions, treat 7-9 as 10+
* Fanatical Devotion
  Ignore the effects of Charisma debilities

## Death Move: Angel of Wrath

*When you die (you fail, or forgo your Last Breath) you can use this move*

When you die, your eyes boil and burn away as holy light pours out of you. Every inch of you radiates hallowed flame. You wield the sword of vengeance, the shield of righteousness, and your gaze pierces the souls of all you look upon. The ground you touch is forever consecrated. Until your wrath is delivered to those deserving nearby, you succeed at every roll and deal max damage. The GM will soon tell you your work here is done.

Embrace serenity, Templar, you have left this putrid world one step closer to absolution.

## Advanced moves

### Red Hot Wrath

The weapon you wield glows hot with holy power, add your current Wrath to your damage. Additionally, Smite costs no Wrath on a 10+.

The armor you wear is charged by the purity of your soul. You ignore the clumsy tag on all armor. When an enemy’s skin touches your armor, they take your current Wrath in damage (ignores armor).

When you use Confession or Inquisitor, you can roll+Wrath instead of +CHA.

### Stench of Guilt

You can sense the guilt that weighs on someone as if it were an odor. Most people have at least a minor stink, but some reek of guilt. Beware of those who have no stench; you know how rare the truly pious are. It’s much more likely you have found genuine evil that feels no guilt at all.

### Warming Up

When an ally Aids you, instead of taking a +1, you can choose to gain 1 Wrath.

### White Knight

### Zealotry

When you use your holy authority to convince a believer to do something clearly dangerous, roll+CHA. ✴On a 7+, they do it, but you must spend a Wrath for each option you select. ✴On a 10+, you can choose one option for free.

* They won’t give up when faced with certain death
