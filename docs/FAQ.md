## What is the default range on the Chaneller's techniques?

By default, every attack has Hand range, unless it has one of the range tags. See all range tags at the end of the *Weapon Tags* section of [Equipment](Equipment.md).

## What HP does the Chaneller's Elemental have?

Whenever your Elemental takes damage, you are "forced" to use the Elemental Protection move, and thus lose one Control.

## How many "Actions" do I have per turn?

(Yes I did mess this up in the OG oneshot)

TL;DR: *Generally speaking* you can only trigger one move yourself. (e.g. Hack and slash, Volley, etc.) However, moves triggered by external factors (e.g. using a Hold from Defend, Defy Danger, etc.) can be used any number of times per turn.

There is technically no limit on the number of moves you can use in a turn. I think it's best to imagine you only have about 6 seconds in your turn, so your own turn will probably involve only using only one of the [Basic moves](Moves/Basic%20moves.md). Keep in mind that Hack and Slash can attack multiple enemies, if you can justify it narratively. (e.g. you are fighting a bunch of grouped up enemies) 

For moves that are triggered by external forces (e.g. Defy Danger when trying to evade a dragon's breath, using a Hold from Defend) you can use them any number of times.

The above rules, as always, are "under" the narrative, if your Necromancer already had a jar ready in his hand when the fighting started, they are probably able to dump the body and raise it as just one Move. (try to remember [Player best practices](Player%20best%20practices.md), and that your action is about 6 seconds)

## Does Elemental Attack (Chaneller)/Attack Command (Necromancer)/Command (Ranger) end my turn? How much damage do they deal?

No. The Chaneller's Elemental Attack deals damage based on your damage dice (plus any tags it has) but does not prevent you yourself from acting offensively. Same for the Necromancer's Attack Command.

For the Ranger's Command, the attack option presupposes that it is working with you.
