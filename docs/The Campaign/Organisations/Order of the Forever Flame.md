This order was founded to fight the creatures of the darkness. If their annals are read, players will find notes about horrific underground monsters.

They will also find references to the wendigos, and *The Nowhere King* himself, tho not mentioned by name, just a symbol to mark him. (drakarn writing is similar to hieroglyphs, the name is just the combination of nowhere/nothing plus king) The order believes this creature is the source of many of the undead that are encroaching on the drakarn kingdom, and worry that they seem to be inching closer and closer to *The Hatchery*.

Monsters mentioned in the annals will include:

* The Wendigo - they do not rot, even when mushrooms are put on them manually
* *Crawling Apocalypse* - they do not serve *The Nowhere King*, except a couple of them. They are artificial, mummified, but seem to exist already, and *The Nowhere King* has just managed  to control a couple.
