This happened around 70 years ago. A dwarven company of warriors, on an expedition to the unknown lands, to uncover ancient temples, and catacombs, and the treasure within, camped near [Saetung](../Places/Saetung.md).

The local government of [Saetung](../Places/Saetung.md) really disliked their presence, and were not trying to hide it. This is the reason they weren't allowed in town, as the leadership of the time was not keen on adventurers, and dwarven adventurers especially.

Tragically, the dwarves were attacked in the middle of the night by wendigos, and were almost all massacred, with only 4 out of 21 surviving. (At this day, they have all died, except for [Glakhel Leatherspine](../Characters/NPCs/Saetung/Glakhel%20Leatherspine.md))

There have since been accusations of the leadership of [Saetung](../Places/Saetung.md) knowing about the wendigos, and leaving the company of dwarves out as basically a sacrifice/tribute to save themselves, but [Saetung](../Places/Saetung.md) leadership maintains to this day, that while they know about wendigos, they never came this close to the village before.
