## Notes

* They talked with the dwarves, and learned more about the *Gashadokuro*, where it comes from

* The mayor is on their side, but the Hunters did an effective coup

* They defeated the *Gashadokuro*, learned about the rune of *The Nowhere King* carved in it's eye sockets. Three dwarves died in the battle, hunters betrayed them.

* Dwarves are friendly, hunters aren't, village evacuation was started.

* [ ] Skirmisher Spear Throw more interesting homebrew @internet ðŸ“… 2023-10-01 

* [ ] [Roo Avery](../Characters/PCs/Roo%20Avery.md) made a spear out of a chunk of the *Gashadokuro*'s heart, and a piece of it's bone, come up with something for it @internet ðŸ“… 2023-10-01
