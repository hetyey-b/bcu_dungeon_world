## Notes

* [Otter](../Characters/PCs/Otter.md) followed the *Gashadokuro* to the edge of the mountains, and actually laid eyes on it
* It smells of a type of 3-in-1 embalming fluid used by drakarn when they have to give burial rites quickly
* They told the Hunter's Guild about the *Gashadokuro*
* The guards raided the dwarven tavern
* [Otter](../Characters/PCs/Otter.md) sneaked into the tavern, and found the room of a cult member, putting on his clothes, and stealing his book
* [Otter](../Characters/PCs/Otter.md) pretended to be a wizard investigator, sneaking out in the robes, but the dwarves did see him in the cult clothing
