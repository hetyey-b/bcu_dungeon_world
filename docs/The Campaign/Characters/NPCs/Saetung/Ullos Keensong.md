# Ullos Keensong

## General

* Gimmick: The halfling mayor of [Saetung](../../../Places/Saetung.md). Son of [Halfer Keensong](Halfer%20Keensong.md), who founded the village.
* Resides in: [Saetung](../../../Places/Saetung.md)
* Weakness: Lives in his father's shadow, doesn't have his strong hold
* Need: To reign in the influential players of the village, be a "harder leader"
* Desire: To be well liked by everyone
* Enemy: [Rakvem Khukeil](Rakvem%20Khukeil.md), the new leader of his father's hunter's guild

---

* Land: [Saetung](../../../Places/Saetung.md)
* Hold: While he is liked by the general populace, he is not a strict enough leader. The most influential people of the town are not on his side: [Korsire Amberhand](Korsire%20Amberhand.md) is friendly with him, but pushed him around. [Rakvem Khukeil](Rakvem%20Khukeil.md) is outright antagonistic.
* Lordly Desire: See [Saetung](../../../Places/Saetung.md) succeed, and grow into a successful and important military frontier town
* Local Problem: The tension between the dwarven community's de facto leader, [Glakhel Leatherspine](Glakhel%20Leatherspine.md), and [Korsire Amberhand](Korsire%20Amberhand.md)
