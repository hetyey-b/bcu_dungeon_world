* Desire: a written guarantee that the leadership will leave the remnants of the battlefield alone

---

* Rumour: knows more about the Massacre then basically anyone else, and knows about the *Gashadokuro* about to appear near [Saetung](../../../Places/Saetung.md)
* Secret: he knows the *Gashadokuro* cannot be appearing due to this few bodies, he just doesn't want them disturbed. He wants people to stay away from the forest - some great massacre has happened there, and they didn't even hear anything. He also believes disturbing the dead could worsen the situation.
* Passion: He is a great singer, with a deep, somber tone, and a seemingly endless catalogue of old dwarven ballads
