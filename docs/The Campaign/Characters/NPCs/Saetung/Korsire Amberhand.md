## General

* Gimmick: salt-of-the-earth, made his own fortune, fairly rich owner of his mining corporation, a halfling, newcomer to Saetung, as he has mines elsewhere
* Resides in: [Saetung](../../../Places/Saetung.md)
* Weakness: he is fully, and deliberately ignorant of any traditions, and "old magic"
* Need: to fear what walks in the night
* Desire: wants to expand his industry, build new quarries, and exploratory tunnels
* Enemy: [Glakhel Leatherspine](Glakhel%20Leatherspine.md), a dwarf who is trying everything not to let him mine a mountain that is the mass grave of his people, and a rival mining entrepreneur

---

* Rumour: experimental drilling shows signs of vast lapis deposits nearby
* Secret: one of those drillings, (which was NOT sanctioned) went into remnants of an old drakarn stronghold
* Passion: he likes to have the comfort of wealth, alongside the "folksy" image, that gives him an endearing quaity
