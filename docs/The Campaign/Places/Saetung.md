### Religious tension

The local dwarven population largely follow a version of ancestor worship, and they are descendants of the survivors of [The Massacre of the Dwarven Company of Whundreth Rockbelly](../Historical%20Events/The%20Massacre%20of%20the%20Dwarven%20Company%20of%20Whundreth%20Rockbelly.md), with the exception of [Glakhel Leatherspine](../Characters/NPCs/Saetung/Glakhel%20Leatherspine.md) , who himself is a survivor of the event.

The dwarves are aware of the curse of the *Gashadokuro*, and their de facto leader, [Glakhel Leatherspine](../Characters/NPCs/Saetung/Glakhel%20Leatherspine.md) has seen signs of one forming nearby.

#### The Gashadokuro

The *Gashadokuro* is really appearing because *The Nowhere King* is roaming the forest, and has massacred a settler group of over 100 drakarn travelling east, and left the bodies out/half eaten by it's wendigos.

* *Impulse:* to massacre everything living in the forest till the spirits of the drakarn dead are put to rest
* *Grim portents:*
  * [Rakvem Khukeil](../Characters/NPCs/Saetung/Rakvem%20Khukeil.md)'s men report hearing dwarven funeral bells in the forest during their patrols - X
  * Bodies of some hunters are found with their heads bitten off, and bodies thrown around
  * Another group of hunters are massacred, this time with one survivor, who tells tales of it suddenly becoming midnight around them, and him desperately running away, before passing out in a river, and being carried down to the village
* *Impending Doom:*
  * The *Gashadokuro* marches on [Saetung](Saetung.md)

#### The wendigo

The wendigos are humanoid people, with armor of wood bark grown on their bodies, and elk skulls for heads. They are spawns of *The Nowhere King*.

* *Impulse:* follow the plan of *The Nowhere King*, to take over the north-eastern area, and uncover the powerful *Drakarn McGuffin* therein
* *Grim portents:*
  * Miners report seeing humans stalk them on their way home late at dark, tho they are not believed at first due to most of them basically never being sober - X
  * A group of miners on their way home are killed, seemingly by elk wounds
  * Another group of miners is killed, [Korsire Amberhand](../Characters/NPCs/Saetung/Korsire%20Amberhand.md) prepares to close the mine, and leave the village
* *Impending Doom:*
  * *The Nowhere King* is not planning on attacking the village, but he will push back all efforts to reclaim the forest.
