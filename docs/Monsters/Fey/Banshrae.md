## Description

Originally relatively harmless fey, who sang, and reveled among their kin. But an elder of theirs once betrayed a capricious fey queen, (exact details lost to time) and were in turn cursed - their mouths were taken.

Centuries later, they made a pact with a dark fey, to regain their musical ability, and are now devoted to fear and grief.

They "eat" by absorbing life force from plants around them while they sleep.

They can use any wooden, bone or metal stick as a flute. Their songs affect everyone who hears them:

* Dread Dirge: Creates deep unease. Listeners are frightened.
* Gibbering Sing-Along: This melody forces listeners to blather meaningless sounds. This makes stealth basically impossible.
* Traveller's Tune: Those affected can move twice as fast as their normal walking speed.

The banshrae may choose who to affect with it's song, but the target has to hear it.

It can also use it's flute as a blowgun. It can use the following special darts once a day each:

* Dart Cone: Produces a 15 foot cone of darts.
* Locust Dart: An opponent struck by this dart is sickened, nauseous, and will throw up a swarm of locusts, that will follow the banshrae's commands.
