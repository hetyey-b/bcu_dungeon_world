## Description

*Hush now, hide, all you little ones  
Rush now, into the middle of nowhere 
Singing and laughter will die*

*Dreamless sleep follows the Nowhere King  
When his kingdom comes, darkness is nigh*

*Quiet, crawl through the in-between
Silent, secretive feeling  
Of fearsome hatred that reaches the skies*

*You will bring joy to the Nowhere King  
When he sees the light leaving your eyes*

Massacres living things, revels in suffering. Seemingly only wants to inflict pain, and to escape wherever it's hidden in another plane.

Antlers also melt and undulate, just like it's body, looks like an ooze, except for the solid elk skull. Insanely gluttonous, may even eat it's own soldiers.

In the original show, it commands minotaurs, but I like a wendigo-like army of elk headed, hunger-cursed cannibals.

In the original story, the bad half of a character that split itself into two from being an elk-centaur into an elk and a human.

Alternative names:

* The Nameless King
* The Veiled King
