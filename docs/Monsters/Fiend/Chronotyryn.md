## Description

A giant crow with humanoid arms, about 3,5 meters tall. Usually carries a giant staff. Hoards magical trinkets, mostly ones they made themselves. Have near genius level intellect.

They have two heads, and thus, two independent brains. Also has two different voices. (creepy, echo-y speech is cool) Has a specific love for time magic, or chronomancy, and is very arrogant about it.

Has a sonic screech that can deafen targets. Since it has two distinct brains, it can make two moves, like cast two spells. It also can concentrate on two spells at once.

## Plot hooks

* Since it is a paranoid hoarder, it can be a good dungeon final boss
* It could be a rumoured creature nesting in some ancient place, a sort of keeper of secrets/magic items role
* You could rip him off for that Avatar the Last Airbender library episode, where it keeps a giant library, but only let's people take stuff if they add something into it
* It could have some connection to Kenku, maybe the only one capable of original speech? Or due to the two voices, even cooler with voice mimicking
* Priest/pope of the Raven Queen, or some other similar death/arcane type god
