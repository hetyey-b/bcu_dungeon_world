## Description

Big mummified octopus/giant squid type thing. (cephalopod) Since it's technically a type of mummy, it is a lot more powerful, then random zombies/skeletons, but also someone 5head, megabrain had to make it. (who?)

Someone had to capture some big sea monster, then mummify it, and transport it to the desert, where it now "swims" in the sand, and does stuff. It is commanded to do something, and then does that forever, regardless of it's original creators' civilisation being long dead.

As with most mummies, it has some fragmented memories of it's life before in the ocean, before becoming just living weapons. They were once the kings of the vast oceans, now replaced with a sea of dry sand, the burning sun, and a magical overlord who took away most of their memories, and free will.

Gargantuan in size, it can break  buildings as well. Attacks with tentacles, and can swing people about. It can infect you with mummy rot disease as well, obviously. It is also quite terrifying, for anyone who can even see it. Maybe also paralyses you with fear. It has tremor sense, so it can't be surprised. Very, very slow, so ambushes people using it's burrowing ability. Vulnerable to fire.

## Plot hooks

* In what context is it involved in the story? Newly created, or made by some ancient evil? Entombed, or roaming free?
* Keep in mind it can attack small towns
* It can also be used as a very metal mount
* Could be used as burrowing troop transport for undead, like that thing in Starcraft 2 by the zergs for extra cool city invasion by undead
* Maybe it is controlled by a MacGuffin. Imagine a dungeon, where the creator was killed in a random lashing out by the Crawling Apocalypse's remaining personality. Now there is a MacGuffin in the hands of a corpse somewhere in the dungeon, and a quite angry, not controlled Crawling Apocalypse roaming around
