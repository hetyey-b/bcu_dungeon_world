## Plot hooks

* You have to seal a living human in some alcoholic liquid, after they drown, a necromancer can raise them by uttering a curse above the barrel
* Can happen accidentally maybe?
* Since it doesn't need to be embalmed and whatnot, basically anyone with a vineyard can make one, if they have the knowledge, they don't need a ton of riches
