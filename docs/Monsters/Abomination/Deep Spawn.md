## Description

A weird looking eye covered meat ball with tentacles, some of which end in monster jaws. First emerged in the underdark, the origin is basically unknown.

It can create a clone of any creature they consumed. The clones are identical in every way, except two: it only has vague recollections of it's memories of what it used to be, and it is fanatically loyal to the Deep Spawn. (Can only be done on "regular" creatures, not elementals, demons, etc.) Making a clone takes like a week or two.

If it keeps cloning the same thing over and over, it starts deteriorating. Mental faculties will be gone with the first new clones, then become more and more "flawed", as in, closer and closer to a lump of mutated flesh.

Attacks with bites, and tentacles, but can hold basically any weapon. It will also probably always have some minions around it.

## Plot hooks

* It can basically be a whole dungeon, along with it's clones. You can give it away early by having two normally opposed monster factions working together
* It could also be a ruler of a small town, it's creatures being the population for a real uncanny vibe, everyone calling the ruler "Mother" or something, no crime between each other, everyone has basically the same morals and opinions, etc.
* In D&D lore, dwarves used them in war, but then outlawed it in fantasy Geneva convention, then their society almost collapsed from it, so they now REALLY hate it
* Someone could also really hate it cause their species fought it - someone sends back clones of your fallen friends to fight you is (not/very) cool
* It is intelligent enough to collaborate with other Deep Spawn, and has a personality
* Steal Xanathar-like shadowy organisation with a Deep Spawn at it's head secretly, but many of it's members are clones (maybe they even "respawn" after being killed, as new clones are made) and they offer a ton of money for interesting monster bodies
* A Jurassic Park/Garden of Eden scenario, where a Deep Spawn is preserving species in some sort of sanctuary
