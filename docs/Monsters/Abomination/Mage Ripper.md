## Description

Probably created artificially. Has bug legs and big maws. Attacks in swarms. About the size of a billiard ball. Has a stinging tail, and pair of tentacles like the displacer beast's.

Have an innate ability to sense magic, be it item, spell, or someone capable of casting, and want to consume it. If they consume enough, they split into more. They can also survive by eating meat, so they might eat someone not magical, if they are hungry enough.

They have intellect comparable to a smart dog. They can't actually eat a magic item, or remove the magic from it in any way, but are still drawn to it.

When they swarm a spell caster, their bite will drain magical energy, while empowering them with temporary HP. They can also end ongoing effects, and heal after them too.

They are blind, so they only really sense magic, thus are easily tricked by a creative party.

## Plot hooks

* Could be a dangerous pest in huge metropolises, where magic is relatively common, so we can send adventurers into the sewers against something more interesting then rats
* They could be used by entirely non-magical armies in battle
* A wizard tower overrun by them, with a barricaded wizard at the top
* Old lich/whatever magic user dungeon overrun by them
* Used as attack/alert dogs by guards in "all magic is banned" cities
