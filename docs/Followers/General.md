Only the penniless and foolhardy undertake an expedition without proper support in the form of porters, hunters, guides, and guards, not to mention specialists who can bring their skills to bear in any number of ways. Followers are those individuals (people, beasts, or monsters) who offer such assistance, accompanying the party on their exploits about the world.

In general, the players can tell the GM what they want their followers to do and expect that they will do it.

Like monsters, followers have HP, Armor, Damage, and Instincts. They usually have moves and/or tags that indicate what they’re good at and how they act. Unlike monsters, they have three additional statis- tics: Quality, Loyalty, and Cost.

### Quality

represents how effective the follower is, particularly in the areas defined by their tags and moves. A follower’s Quality can range from -1 (rubbish) to +3 (masterful). A follower of average competence has a Quality of 0.

### Loyalty

racks the follower’s commitment to you and your cause. It usually starts at +1 but may change, ranging from -2 to +3. When a follower’s Loyalty drops to -3, they betray or abandon you. Note that Loyalty is a resource that can be used up by the GM. 

### Cost

describes what motivates the follower to follow. Although a strong leader or worthy cause can be a motivating factor, all but the most selfless followers do the dirty work in exchange for coin or other material reward. A follower’s Loyalty is increased when you pay their Cost. Note that a Cost is not always a tangible thing.

Followers can deal and take damage, at the GM’s discretion or when indicated by a move. When they would deal damage, you roll their damage die. When they take damage, they lose HP. When they’re reduced to 0 HP, they’re out of the action and probably dead or dying—their fate is in the GM’s hands.
