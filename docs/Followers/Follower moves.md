## Follower moves

Followers can make the standard Encumbrance, Make Camp, and Recover moves, and can make the Last Breath move at the GM’s discretion. Unless otherwise noted, they don’t make any of the basic moves. Instead, use those presented on the following page. 

### Recruit

When you go looking to hire help, tell the GM what you’re offering and whom you’re looking for, phrased in one of the following ways:

* A group of ______ (porters, guards, 			 minstrels, angry farmers, etc.)
* A skilled ______ (guide, sage, burglar, bodyguard, etc.)

A group is a follower like any other, but with the group tag.

If the GM says you can’t find that kind of help in a place like this, start over or move on. Otherwise, roll +nothing and take +1 if you have a good reputation in these parts: on a 10+, they’re yours for the hiring; on a 7-9, the GM chooses 1 from the list below. on a 6-, no one shows, but mark XP.

* They demand greater compensation, in coin or some other form
* No one here fits the bill, but you hear of someone elsewhere who does
* They have a need that must be met first(permission from someone else, a favor, etc.)
* You can tell at a glance that they’re less than ideal (ask the GM how) 

The GM will choose or roll their specifics (Quality, Loyalty, Instinct, Cost, tags, etc.) as needed, to be discovered through play. Which might involve you grilling them,
right now.

### Order Follower

When you order or expect a follower to do something dangerous, degrading, or contrary to their Instinct, roll +Loyalty: on a 10+, they do it, now; on a 7-9, they do it, but the GM picks one from the list below; on a 6-, mark XP, and the GM makes a move.

* Decrease the follower’s Loyalty by 1
* They complain loudly, now or later, 			 and demand something in return
* Caution, laziness, or fear makes 			 them take a long time to get it done

### Do Their Thing

When a follower *does something chancy within the scope of their tags or moves*, roll +Quality: on a 10+, they do it, as well as one could reasonably hope; on a 7-9, they do it, but there’s an unforeseen cost, consequence, or limitation (ask the GM what); on a 6-, mark XP, and the GM makes a move.

When a follower *does something chancy that falls beyond the scope of their tags or moves*, or does anything on their own, the GM says what happens.

### Call for Assistance

When a follower helps you make a move that calls for a roll, take +1 to that roll, but know that they will be exposed to any potential consequences.

When a follower helps you Hack and Slash or Volley, roll their damage die alongside your own, use the higher result, and add any damage bonuses you get on top of that. When a follower helps you Defend, you can spend 1 hold to redirect an attack to them instead of yourself.

### Pay Up

When you pay a follower’s Cost, increase their Loyalty by 1 (to a maximum of +3). You can’t trigger this move again until both you and your follower have Made Camp together.

### Watch Them Go

When a follower has -3 Loyalty, they betray or abandon you at the next opportunity.

## Creating Followers

Give each follower a name, roll on one or more of the NPC tables below, and play to find out more about them. When you need specifics, follow the instructions under the relevant entry below. If you’re prepping followers ahead of time, follow the steps in order.

### Quality

GM chooses one, or roll 1d12.

|1d12|quality|
|----|-------|
|1-3|A liability: Quality -1, +0 tags|
|4-9|Reasonably competent: Quality +0, +1 tags|
|10-11|Fully capable: Quality +1, +2 tags|
|12|An exceptional individual: Quality +2, +4 tags|

### Background

GM chooses one, or roll 1d12.

|1d12|background|
|----|----------|
|1-2|Has lived a life of servitude and oppression: +meek|
|3|Past their prime: -1 to Quality, +1 wise (see Tags, below)|
|4-5|Has lived a life of danger: +2 tags|
|6-9|Unremarkable|
|10|Has lived a life of privilege: +1 tag|
|11|Specialist: +1 to Quality, -2 tags|
|12|Roll 1d10+1 twice on this table|

### Tags

The first tag every follower has is a wise, expressed as \_\_\_\_-wise, where the blank is filled by whatever subject or thing the follower knows best. Write down the follower’s wise.

If the follower has more than 1 tag, choose additional tags from the Follower Tags list, either now or as needed. Optionally, you can replace a tag with an extra move (see next step).

### Moves

A follower move reflects a skill, ability, or trait that can’t be better summarized by a tag. Examples include:

* Point out a flaw in the plan
* Notice something hidden
* Follow quarry by tracks and spoor
* Tend to the sick and injured
* Divine the future
* Poison someone

Write 1-3 moves for the follower that further describe their behavior and abilities. These are for you, the GM, to use like other GM moves, when the players look to you to see what the follower does, or when they give you a golden opportunity.

The players might order or expect a fol lower to use one of these moves on their behalf. That’s fine, but consider whether Order Followers or Do Their Thing (see above) applies to the situation.

### Loyalty

By default, a new follower starts with Loyalty +1, but the GM may add or subtract 1 Loyalty to reflect the follower’s initial disposition and their respect (or lack thereof ) for the characters they follow.

### Instinct

What does the follower do naturally that might cause trouble? Choose one, makeone up, or roll 1d12.

|1d12|instinct|
|----|--------|
|1|Loot, pillage, and burn|
|2|Hold a grudge and seek payback|
|3|Question leadership or authority|
|4-5|Lord over others|
|6-7|Act impulsively|
|8-9|Give in to temptation|
|10-11|Slack off|
|12|Avoid danger or punishment|

### Cost

What motivates the follower to accompany and assist the characters? Choose one, make one up, or roll 1d12.

|1d12|cost|
|----|----|
|1|*Debauchery*: food, drink, gambling, sex, mischief, etc. The higher their Loyalty, the more extreme the cost.|
|2|*Vengeance*: payback against those that have wronged them or their loved ones. The higher their Quality, the more direct and tangible the payback they require.|
|3-5|*Lucre*: coin appropriate to their steading’s Prosperity; highly skilled followers might demand more.|
|6-7|*Renown*: public recognition for their deeds and skills. The higher their Quality, the larger the audience required.|
|8-9|*Glory*: defeating a worthy foe in battle. The higher their Quality, the more worthy the foe must be. Possibly limited to certain enemy types (demons, barbarians, etc.).|
|10|*Affection*: kind words and deeds, quality time and attention. The more extreme their Loyalty, the more affection they require.|
|11|*Knowledge*: secrets, mysteries, and wonders only found by exploring the wider world.|
|12|*Good*: suffering alleviated, innocents defended, wrongs righted. The higher their Quality, the greater the good required.|

### Hit points

How resilient are they? Pick one or roll:

|1d12|hit points|
|----|----------|
|1-3|Weak/frail/soft: 3 HP|
|4-9|Able-bodied: 6 HP|
|10-12|Tough/strong/hard: 9 HP|

### Armor & shield

Choose what armor they wear and/or give them a shield, according to their background as you understand it so far:

* None: 0 Armor
* Hides or leather: 1 Armor
* Scale or chain: 2 Armor
* Plate: 3 Armor
* Shield: +1 Armor

### Damage

How dangerous are they in a fight? Pick one according to who they are, or roll.

|1d12|damage|
|----|------|
|1-4|Not very dangerous: d4 damage|
|5-10|Can defend themselves: d6 damage|
|11-12|Veteran fighter: d8 damage|

Assign range & tags based on the weapons they wield.

### Load & gear

In addition to arms, armor, and any other tools of their trade, human-sized followers have a Load of 2. Equip them based on their circumstances and the Prosperity of their home steading.
