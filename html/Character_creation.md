<h2 id="choose-a-playbook">1) Choose a playbook</h2>
<p>Look over the [[Character playbooks]] and choose one. It is recommended that there are no duplicates in the party.</p>
<h2 id="choose-a-species">2) Choose a species</h2>
<p>Look over the [[Character species]] and choose one. It will give you one or more special moves.</p>
<h2 id="choose-a-name">3) Choose a name</h2>
<h2 id="choose-how-you-look">4) Choose how you look</h2>
<h2 id="choose-stats">5) Choose stats</h2>
<p>Assign these scores to your stats: 16, 15, 13, 12, 9, 8. Start by looking over the basic moves and the starting moves for your class. Pick out the move that interests you the most: something you’ll be doing a lot, or something that you excel at. Put a 16 in the stat for that move. Look over the list again and pick out the next most important move to your character, maybe something that supports your first choice. Put your 15 in the stat for that move. Repeat this process for your remaining scores: 13, 12, 9, 8.</p>
<h2 id="figure-out-modifiers">6) Figure out modifiers</h2>
<p>Next you need to figure out the modifiers for your stats. The modifiers are what you use when a move says +DEX or +CHA. If you’re using the standard character sheets the modifiers are already listed with each score.</p>

<h2 id="set-maximum-hp">7) Set maximum HP</h2>
<p>Your maximum HP is equal to your class’s base HP plus your Constitution <em>score</em>. (Not modifier!)</p>
<h3 id="choose-starting-moves">8) Choose starting moves</h3>
<p>You have all your starting [[Moves]] available, but some classes need to make choices as part of those moves. For example the Wizard has to choose spells for their book. The Wizard and the Cleric have to choose the spells they prepare.</p>
<h2 id="choose-alignment">9) Choose alignment</h2>
<p>Choose your alignment from the ones available to your class playbook. You can read more in [[Bonds and Alignment]].</p>
<h2 id="choose-gear">10) Choose gear</h2>
<p>Each class has some choices to make when choosing starting gear. Keep your load in mind, it limits how much you can carry.</p>
<h2 id="introduce-your-character">11) Introduce your character</h2>
<p>Now that you know who your character is, it’s time to introduce them to everyone else. Wait until everyone’s finished choosing their name. Then go around the table; when it’s your turn, share your look, class and anything else pertinent about your character. You can share your alignment now or keep it a secret if you prefer. This is also the time for the GM to ask questions. The GM’s questions should help establish the relationships between characters (“What do you think about that?”) and draw the group into the adventure (“Does that mean you’ve met Grundloch before?”). The GM should listen to everything in the description and ask about anything that stands out. Establish where they’re from, who they are, how they came together, or anything else that seems relevant or interesting.</p>
<h2 id="choose-your-bonds">12) Choose your bonds</h2>
<p>Once everyone has described their characters you can choose your bonds. You must fill in one bond but it’s in your best interest to fill in more. For each blank fill in the name of one character. You can use the same character for more than one statement. Take some time to discuss the bonds and let the GM ask questions about them as they come up. You’ll want to go back and forth and make sure everyone is happy and comfortable with how the bonds have come out. Leave space to discover what each one might mean in play, too: don’t pre-determine everything at the start. Once everyone’s filled in their bonds read them out to the group. When a move has you roll+Bond you’ll count the number of bonds you have with the character in question and add that to the roll. You can read more in [[Bonds and Alignment]].</p>
<h2 id="get-ready-to-play">13) Get ready to play</h2>
<p>Take a little break: grab a drink, stretch your legs and let the GM brainstorm for a little bit about what they’ve learned about your characters. Once you’re all ready, grab your dice and your sheet and get ready to take on the dungeon.</p>
