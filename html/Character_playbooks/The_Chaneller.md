<h3 id="channel">Channel</h3>
<p>When you open your Conduit up wide and channel magic through your body, roll +CON. ✴On a 10+, raw magic of your Primary Element flows out of your Emanation Point. Use one of your Techniques. ✴On a 7-9, the same, but the power is too much. You can use your body as a dam and take 1d4 damage (ignores armor) or allow the power through. If you allow the power through, the GM will tell you of one or more complications, such as: - The magic flows out of a different part of your body or is of a different element - The magic has an unintended effect on the environment - It causes a blast wave and you’re thrown backwards</p>

<p>When you beckon inwards to call forth an Elemental being, choose any Technique tag and roll+CON. ✴On a 10+, the Elemental flows out of you and a stream of magic connects it to your Emanation Point like a leash.

You gain 1d4 Control. ✴On a 7-9, the Elemental is also moody or troublesome, choose one: - You must immediately spend 1 Control - It embodies a different tag instead (the GM will tell you which) - It resents you and will certainly be hostile later As long as the Elemental remains leashed, you have the Elemental Protection and Elemental Attack moves.
