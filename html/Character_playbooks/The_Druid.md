<h3 id="born-of-the-soil">Born of the Soil</h3>
<p>You learned your magic in a place whose spirits are strong and ancient and they’ve marked you as one of their own. No matter where you go, they live within you and allow you to take their shape. Choose one of the following. It is the land to which you are attuned — when shapeshifting you may take the shape of any animal who might live in your Land. - The Great Forests - The Whispering Plains - The Vast Desert - The Stinking Mire - The River Delta - The Depths of the Earth - The Sapphire Islands - The Open Sea - The Towering Mountains - The Frozen North - The Blasted Wasteland Chose a tell — a physical attribute that marks you as born of the soil — that reflects the spirit of your land. It may be an animal feature like antlers or leopard’s spots or something more general: hair like leaves or eyes of glittering crystal. Your tell remains no matter what shape you take.</p>

You may take on the physical form of any species whose essence you have studied or who lives in your land: you and your possessions meld into a perfect copy of the species’ form. You have any innate abilities and weaknesses of the form: claws, wings, gills, breathing water instead of air. You still use your normal stats but some moves may be harder to trigger—a housecat will find it hard to do battle with an ogre. The GM will also tell you one or more moves associated with your new form. Spend 1 hold to make that move. Once you’re out of hold, you return to your natural form. At any time, you may spend all your hold and revert to your natural form.</p>
